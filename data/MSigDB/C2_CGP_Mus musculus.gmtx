LANDIS_BREAST_CANCER_PROGRESSION_UP	M6875		16434967	Landis MD,Seachrist DD,Abdul-Karim FW,Keri RA	GSE3501	Table 1S			MG_U74Av2	Lauren Kazmierski	Broad Institute	Genes up-regulated in preneoplastic mammary tissues and whose expression is maintained in tumors.	Epidemiological studies indicate that parity enhances HER2/ErbB2/Neu-induced breast tumorigenesis. Furthermore, recent studies using multiparous, ErbB2/Neu-overexpressing mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV-Neu) mice have shown that parity induces a population of cells that are targeted for ErbB2/Neu-induced transformation. Although parity accelerates mammary tumorigenesis, the pattern of tumor development in multiparous MMTV-Neu mice remains stochastic, suggesting that additional events are required for ErbB2/Neu to cause mammary tumors. Whether such events are genetic in nature or reflective of the dynamic hormonal control of the gland that occurs with pregnancy remains unclear. We postulated that young age at pregnancy initiation or chronic trophic maintenance of mammary epithelial cells might provide a cellular environment that significantly increases susceptibility to ErbB2/Neu-induced tumorigenesis. MMTV-Neu mice that were maintained pregnant or lactating beginning at 3 weeks of age demonstrated accelerated tumorigenesis, but this process was still stochastic, indicating that early pregnancy does not provide the requisite events of tumorigenesis. However, bitransgenic mice that were generated by breeding MMTV-Neu mice with a luteinizing hormone-overexpressing mouse model of ovarian hyperstimulation developed multifocal mammary tumors in an accelerated, synchronous manner compared to virgin MMTV-Neu animals. This synchrony of tumor development in the bitransgenic mice suggests that trophic maintenance of the mammary gland provides the additional events required for tumor formation and maintains the population of cells that are targeted by ErbB2/Neu for transformation. Both the synchrony of tumor appearance and the ability to characterize a window of commitment by ovariectomy/palpation studies permitted microarray analysis to evaluate changes in gene expression over a defined timeline that spans the progression from normal to preneoplastic mammary tissue. These approaches led to identification of several candidate genes whose expression changes in the mammary gland with commitment to ErbB2/Neu-induced tumorigenesis, suggesting that they may either be regulated by ErbB2/Neu and/or contribute to tumor formation.					349633	2182	284996	1366	3732	3664	1611	27230	6659	2591	5349	230	6728	3783	10159	25978	202	7494	9208	3934	7022	55907	7421	7163	26298	6692	55342	79191	54463	9516	1829	51188	1534	23286	3398	523	57619	10682	80148	4925	51599	22936	64083	1365

Here, we show that ectopic expression of the catalytic subunit of mouse telomerase (mTert) confers a growth advantage to primary murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), which have very long telomeres, as well as facilitates their spontaneous immortalization and increases their colony-forming capacity upon activation of oncogenes. We demonstrate that these telomere length-independent growth-promoting effects of mTert overexpression require catalytically active mTert, as well as the formation of mTert/Terc complexes. The gene expression profile of mTert-overexpressing MEFs indicates that telomerase enhances growth in these cells through the repression of growth-inhibiting genes of the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) signaling network. We functionally validate this result by showing that mTert abrogates the growth-inhibitory effect of TGF-beta in MEFs, thus demonstrating that telomerase increments the proliferative potential of primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts by targeting the TGF-beta pathway.					1839	8553	6478	4783	7071	7832	1848	54206	23462	9314	64332	10912	1959	7538	2006	8870	687	4616	2354	3726	3164

Mutational activation of ras genes is required for the onset and maintenance of different malignancies. Here we show, using a combination of molecular physiology, nutritional perturbations and transcriptional profiling, that full penetrance of phenotypes related to oncogenic Ras activation, including the shift of carbon metabolism towards fermentation and upregulation of key cell cycle regulators, is dependent upon glucose availability. These responses are induced by Ras activation, being specifically reverted by downregulation of the Ras pathway obtained through the expression of a dominant-negative Ras-specific guanine nucleotide exchange protein.

We characterized differential gene expression profiles of fibroblast cell lines harboring single or double-homozygous null mutations in H-ras and N-ras. Whereas the expression level of the individual H-, N- and K-ras genes appeared unaffected by the presence or absence of the other ras loci, significant differences were observed between the expression profiles of cells missing N-ras and/or H-ras. Absence of N-ras produced much stronger effects than absence of H-ras over the profile of the cellular transcriptome. N-ras(-/-) and H-ras(-/-) fibroblasts displayed rather antagonistic expression profiles and the transcriptome of H-ras(-/-) cells was significantly closer to that of wild-type fibroblasts than to that of N-ras(-/-) cells. Classifying all differentially expressed genes into functional categories suggested specific roles for H-Ras and N-Ras. It was particularly striking in N-ras(-/-) cells the upregulation of a remarkable number of immunity-related genes, as well as of several loci involved in apoptosis. Reverse-phase protein array assays demonstrated in the same N-ras(-/-) cells the overexpression and nuclear migration of tyrosine phosphorylated signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (Stat1) which was concomitant with transcriptional activation mediated by interferon-stimulated response elements. Significantly enhanced numbers of apoptotic cells were also detected in cultures of N-ras(-/-) cells. Our data support the notion that different Ras isoforms play functionally distinct cellular roles and indicate that N-Ras is significantly involved in immune modulation/host defense and apoptotic responses.					3224	7001	2671	2782	4826

Reverse-phase protein array assays demonstrated in the same N-ras(-/-) cells the overexpression and nuclear migration of tyrosine phosphorylated signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (Stat1) which was concomitant with transcriptional activation mediated by interferon-stimulated response elements. Significantly enhanced numbers of apoptotic cells were also detected in cultures of N-ras(-/-) cells. Our data support the notion that different Ras isoforms play functionally distinct cellular roles and indicate that N-Ras is significantly involved in immune modulation/host defense and apoptotic responses.					388581	6205	81846	3265	6510	83640

Functional inactivation of the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor gene product (RB) is a common event in human cancers. Classically, RB functions to constrain cellular proliferation, and loss of RB is proposed to facilitate the hyperplastic proliferation associated with tumorigenesis. To understand the repertoire of regulatory processes governed by RB, two models of RB loss were utilized to perform microarray analysis. In murine embryonic fibroblasts harboring germline loss of RB, there was a striking deregulation of gene expression, wherein distinct biological pathways were altered. Specifically, genes involved in cell cycle control and classically associated with E2F-dependent gene regulation were upregulated via RB loss. In contrast, a program of gene expression associated with immune function and response to pathogens was significantly downregulated with the loss of RB. To determine the specific influence of RB loss during a defined period and without the possibility of developmental compensation as occurs in embryonic fibroblasts, a second system was employed wherein Rb was acutely knocked out in adult fibroblasts. This model confirmed the distinct regulation of cell cycle and immune modulatory genes through RB loss. Analyses of cis-elements supported the hypothesis that the majority of those genes upregulated with RB loss are regulated via the E2F family of transcription factors. In contrast, those genes whose expression was reduced with the loss of RB harbored different promoter elements. Consistent with these analyses, we found that disruption of E2F-binding function of RB was associated with the upregulation of gene expression. In contrast, cells harboring an RB mutant protein (RB-750F) that retains E2F-binding activity, but is specifically deficient in the association with LXCXE-containing proteins, failed to upregulate these same target genes.

Thus, these studies demonstrate that RB plays a significant role in both the positive and negative regulations of transcriptional programs and indicate that loss of RB has distinct biological effects related to both cell cycle control and immune function.					4784	84733	5424	55038	1017	2625	374	23452	3482	6405	5933	2620	1958	3783	10447	1293	5422	244	10166	2719	1759	1595	1396	2697	835	5111	22821	1381	9748	2936	29128	4664	1786	4124	64094	10112	285	7153	221883	3207	10549	5627	2222	10572	358	5983	5865	2146	8208	9180	340419	23397	23234	27445	125965	10591	11169	27086	56475	1462	5277	9173	51433	9314	4436	256949	6444	2628	865	54962	8460	81620	1026	9265	4833	5371	6484	23466	3418	5593	6382	7515	11075	283120	675	83879	11000	7083	27123	10541	9202	79071	3422	4047	4591	3925	4171	5557	6510	3303	3992	5360	39	5156	2073	6423	54810	22955	1796	4176	7884	186	4216	6713	6387

Functional inactivation of the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor gene product (RB) is a common event in human cancers. Classically, RB functions to constrain cellular proliferation, and loss of RB is proposed to facilitate the hyperplastic proliferation associated with tumorigenesis. To understand the repertoire of regulatory processes governed by RB, two models of RB loss were utilized to perform microarray analysis. In murine embryonic fibroblasts harboring germline loss of RB, there was a striking deregulation of gene expression, wherein distinct biological pathways were altered. Specifically, genes involved in cell cycle control and classically associated with E2F-dependent gene regulation were upregulated via RB loss. In contrast, a program of gene expression associated with immune function and response to pathogens was significantly downregulated with the loss of RB. To determine the specific influence of RB loss during a defined period and without the possibility of developmental compensation as occurs in embryonic fibroblasts, a second system was employed wherein Rb was acutely knocked out in adult fibroblasts. This model confirmed the distinct regulation of cell cycle and immune modulatory genes through RB loss. Analyses of cis-elements supported the hypothesis that the majority of those genes upregulated with RB loss are regulated via the E2F family of transcription factors. In contrast, those genes whose expression was reduced with the loss of RB harbored different promoter elements. Consistent with these analyses, we found that disruption of E2F-binding function of RB was associated with the upregulation of gene expression. In contrast, cells harboring an RB mutant protein (RB-750F) that retains E2F-binding activity, but is specifically deficient in the association with LXCXE-containing proteins, failed to upregulate these same target genes. However, downregulation of genes involved in immune function was readily observed with disruption of the LXCXE-binding function of RB. Thus, these studies demonstrate that RB plays a significant role in both the positive and negative regulations of transcriptional programs and indicate that loss of RB has distinct biological effects related to both cell cycle control and immune function.					7001	65997	72	58	7345	6196	7319	4814	7078	23705	51316	963	3663	348	10765	55740	2560	713	100506736	123	8935	56922	51554	101	533	65009	7941	26225	8347	1234	79709	26268	2941	10567	388	3965	116143	1956	23166	4232	25849	714	1436	79683	712	5654	56061	3937	51669	51186	23710	28232	83706	3485	7305	55752	7042	4321	8840	3162	3875	2791	7164	2707	84299	23646	5947	8878	63027	51734	51393	3713	719	5199	4481	4005	2173	5788	5445	5925	1906	5973	1520	81502	3248	10437	4883	1634	3486	10671	7166	338339	3569	9051	7035	1356	7409	4322	6347	6511	54544	761	284996	133619	929	7006	255626	127544	80761	64231	57619	6688	10962	6348	5552	9145	4803	26471

GRAESSMANN_APOPTOSIS_BY_SERUM_DEPRIVATION_UP	M1097		17160024	Graessmann M,Berg B,Fuchs B,Klein A,Graessmann A		Online supplement ME-ACells0PercFCS.xls			MOUSE_GENE_SYMBOL	Arthur Liberzon	Broad Institute	Genes up-regulated in ME-A cells (breast cancer) undergoing apoptosis upon serum starvation (5% to 0% FCS) for 22 hr.	Impairment of the complex regulatory network of cell death and survival is frequently the reason for therapy resistance of breast cancer cells and a major cause of tumor progression. We established two independent cell lines from a fast growing mouse breast tumor (WAP-SVT/t transgenic animal). Cells from one line (ME-A cells) are sensitive to apoptotic stimuli such as growth factor depletion or treatment with antitumor agents (e.g. doxorubicin). Cells from the second line (ME-C cells), which carry a missense mutation at the p53 codon 242, are very insensitive to apoptotic stimuli. Co-cultivation experiments revealed that the ME-C cells mediate cell death resistance to the ME-A cells. Microarray and Western blot analysis showed that osteopontin (OPN) is selectively overexpressed by the ME-C cells. This glycoprotein is the most abundant protein secreted by the ME-C cells and we obtained strong indications that OPN is the main antiapoptotic factor. However, the OPN containing ME-C cell medium does not alter the expression level of pro- or antiapoptotic genes or known inhibitors of apoptosis (IAPs). Its signaling involves mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) kinase (MEK)1/2 as the kinase inhibitor PD98059 restores apoptosis but not the Akt inhibitor. In the ME-A cells, mitochondrial cytochrome c release occurs with and without external apoptotic stimuli.

GRAESSMANN_APOPTOSIS_BY_SERUM_DEPRIVATION_DN	M1098		17160024	Graessmann M,Berg B,Fuchs B,Klein A,Graessmann A		Online supplement ME-ACells0PercFCS.xls			MOUSE_GENE_SYMBOL	Arthur Liberzon	Broad Institute	Genes down-regulated in ME-A cells (breast cancer) undergoing apoptosis upon serum starvation (5% to 0% FCS) for 22 hr.	Impairment of the complex regulatory network of cell death and survival is frequently the reason for therapy resistance of breast cancer cells and a major cause of tumor progression. We established two independent cell lines from a fast growing mouse breast tumor (WAP-SVT/t transgenic animal). Cells from one line (ME-A cells) are sensitive to apoptotic stimuli such as growth factor depletion or treatment with antitumor agents (e.g. doxorubicin). Cells from the second line (ME-C cells), which carry a missense mutation at the p53 codon 242, are very insensitive to apoptotic stimuli. Co-cultivation experiments revealed that the ME-C cells mediate cell death resistance to the ME-A cells. Microarray and Western blot analysis showed that osteopontin (OPN) is selectively overexpressed by the ME-C cells. This glycoprotein is the most abundant protein secreted by the ME-C cells and we obtained strong indications that OPN is the main antiapoptotic factor. However, the OPN containing ME-C cell medium does not alter the expression level of pro- or antiapoptotic genes or known inhibitors of apoptosis (IAPs). Its signaling involves mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) kinase (MEK)1/2 as the kinase inhibitor PD98059 restores apoptosis but not the Akt inhibitor. In the ME-A cells, mitochondrial cytochrome c release occurs with and without external apoptotic stimuli. OPN containing ME-C cell medium does not prevent the mitochondrial cytochrome c release and caspase-9 processing. In serum starved ME-A cells, the OPN containing ME-C cell medium prevents caspase-3 activation. However, in doxorubicin-treated cells, although apoptosis is blocked, it does not inhibit caspase-3. This indicates that the ME-A cells distinguish between the initial apoptotic stimuli and that the cells possess a further uncharacterized control element acting downstream from caspase-3.					7069	4162	8864	3720	9451	8974	4867	140576	64840	4846	390816	57406	23400	84270	10131	30011	23014	5578	9696	5277	1843	123096	2001	27254	7170	1591	2812	26136	81492	7133	728229	9910	4603	2027	140809	2997	133746	2729	80321	79006	57462	161253	55502	3001	7163	6793	3162	51234	1003	2152	7412	25803	59339	5054	3601	27163	25994	3795	5217	57412	23324	57332	822	54987	5118	6415	8566	20	60626	80325	726	8125	283987	1039	5163	1759	10200	26284	80148	771	22976	11188	200010	1852	4843	5817	119032	2859	3725	26011	26608	55129	124739	3198	7052	7422	160622	8786	8928	51061	128869	5326	8497	6314	2939	9091	9352	4957	687	64780	1992	1395	664	859	9532	390213	55007	839	24142	4502	27090	2624	5413	51501	80198	4131	80167	257	9911	1264	23452	51642	4355	5317	5624	55901	54566	55911	170689	10397	9529	64077	9649	51728	3770	2026	10954	51768	5318	9260	65009	5862	2323	4678	63916	23144	79180	140685	5874	599	26353	2651	2819	84557	115330	79798	3932	3257	202052	10914	23162	10938	55520	53335	10460	5648	54583	3632	8214	6781	1365	2632	6509	9456	23175	3796	221178	9545	80862	51199	404550	64798	124056	9080	6513	11140	3757	1907	284366	55748	5826	9276	445	114880	3714	547	1534	26355	165324	8913	3960	55909	84649	25946	3398	3373	11015	9382	7456	29923	80303	3669	4975	84824	768	10411	3861	2584	9862	7704	30001	51097	1408	5507

Upregulation of HER2/ErbB2/Neu occurs in 15-30% of human breast cancers and correlates with poor prognosis. Identification of ErbB2/Neu transcriptional targets should facilitate development of novel therapeutic approaches. Development of breast cancer is a multistep process; thus, to identify the transcriptomes associated with different stages of progression of tumorigenesis, we compared expression profiles of mammary tumors and preneoplastic mammary tissue from MMTV-Neu transgenic mice to expression profiles of wild-type mammary glands using Affymetrix microarrays. We identified 324 candidate genes that were unique to ErbB2/Neu-induced tumors relative to normal mammary gland tissue from wild-type controls. Expression of a subset of these genes (82) was also changed in the preneoplastic mammary glands compared to wild-type controls, indicating that they may play a pivotal role during early events of ErbB2/Neu-initiated mammary tumorigenesis. Further analysis of the microarray data revealed that expression of several known transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta target genes was altered, suggesting that the TGF-beta signaling cascade is downregulated in ErbB2/Neu-induced tumors. Western blot analysis for TGF-beta-Receptor-I/ALK5 and immunohistochemistry for TGF-beta-Receptor-I/ALK5 and phosphorylated/activated Smad2 confirmed that the Smad-dependent TGF-beta signaling cascade was inactive in these tumors. Although absent in most of the tumor, phosphorylated Smad2 was present in the periphery of tumors. Interestingly, presence of phosphorylated/activated Smad2 correlated with expression of Activin-Receptor-IB/ALK4, suggesting that although Smad-dependent TGF-beta signaling is absent in ErbB2/Neu-induced tumors, Activin signaling may be active at the leading edge of these tumors. Cumulatively, these data indicate that the TGF-beta pathway is intrinsically suppressed in ErbB2/Neu tumors via a mechanism involving loss of TGF-beta-Receptor-I/ALK5.					523	27230	9601	64083	8738	64065	56005	9532	928	22931	3709	85462	7164	55884	2348	1848	3340	1829	56925	3482	1611	55907

Impairment of the complex regulatory network of cell death and survival is frequently the reason for therapy resistance of breast cancer cells and a major cause of tumor progression. We established two independent cell lines from a fast growing mouse breast tumor (WAP-SVT/t transgenic animal). Cells from one line (ME-A cells) are sensitive to apoptotic stimuli such as growth factor depletion or treatment with antitumor agents (e.g. doxorubicin). Cells from the second line (ME-C cells), which carry a missense mutation at the p53 codon 242, are very insensitive to apoptotic stimuli. Co-cultivation experiments revealed that the ME-C cells mediate cell death resistance to the ME-A cells. Microarray and Western blot analysis showed that osteopontin (OPN) is selectively overexpressed by the ME-C cells. This glycoprotein is the most abundant protein secreted by the ME-C cells and we obtained strong indications that OPN is the main antiapoptotic factor. However, the OPN containing ME-C cell medium does not alter the expression level of pro- or antiapoptotic genes or known inhibitors of apoptosis (IAPs). Its signaling involves mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) kinase (MEK)1/2 as the kinase inhibitor PD98059 restores apoptosis but not the Akt inhibitor. In the ME-A cells, mitochondrial cytochrome c release occurs with and without external apoptotic stimuli. OPN containing ME-C cell medium does not prevent the mitochondrial cytochrome c release and caspase-9 processing. In serum starved ME-A cells, the OPN containing ME-C cell medium prevents caspase-3 activation. However, in doxorubicin-treated cells, although apoptosis is blocked, it does not inhibit caspase-3. This indicates that the ME-A cells distinguish between the initial apoptotic stimuli and that the cells possess a further uncharacterized control element acting downstream from caspase-3.					11167	827	23604	5610	10906	26052	23598	718	6891	2002	10379	54453	83666	2944	55601	129607	3434	3977	3549	50674	6414	10039	11098	441151	64802	83461	159296	6354	6865	57419	100506736	8434	115207	81030	3988	23531	84247	26092	153339	3437	6347	8507	2690	57717	3667	10242	8851	4600	28951	355	91653	7098	7416	131669	23157	5514	5699	50509	64108	27316	85445	6772	103	3551	1950	90102	3217	54550	130497	3375	94241	5744	138151	3625	84858	81603	1290	55196	23293	79894	2006	29843	64761	55733	3490	4691	25840	840	2214	10395	6785	113	284	7318	55281	137886	5150	4690	9636	50511	201134	1435	56257	23481	8839	64135	8625	29761	25939	4065	25890	4969	9473	2242	5551	3133	5159	3827	23315	53840	6249	11274	56121	3433	1394	6648	64222	3665	340348	51277	79977	7112	10383	6737	27122	30814	79689	78988	6833	255488	4837	5204	10969	4599	4939	83734	84895	60	345611	28996	3659	3431	629	56937	633	375287	3218	1281	24147	684	85441	90634	91543	3959	388646	114790	55106	8997	6672	3742	4232	54625	645638	5549	5018	7706	1758	3215	643	1285	4653	8651	1297	734	5456	3500	4739	3290	57544	7097	3291	22849	3430	50937	914	3627	109	5339	3660	158046	613	26190	1356	10561	10628	118980	358	4337	64921	8110	112495

caspase-3.					50848	533	6468	7111	25865	2302	55364	10244	90637	94234	1302	90411	9491	445	10807	56886	8726	7135	148713	116985	23218	1263	339230	11173	9926	140739	8575	3635	83443	51702	8310	10602	85027	317	5528	6768	114294	10314	1958	7286	1376	114789	319	54658	23406	60673	1785	27030	134492	55700	150864	11212	55124	27351	6477	2214	11132	60626	3300	1978	1848	2353	5816	22795	123096	6120	57617	79174	5031	51426	10766	64802	7477	11020	54600	6258	57542	9051	7102	5228	4644	57026	10370	1948	4193	205	10362	10978	5393	4975	223082	134728	317649	25907	6692	2671	83463	4097	55092	1311	51184	83742	8819	80318	22919	65977	64782	2591	283229	80315	5358	9197	5331	26100	9659	23005	83637	29927	201163	100	254170	10809	3606	28955	573	201299	823	3291	649	22954	5972	256302	79589	7538	25807	7016	1616	5547	80305	79041	374	3460	8851	389125	7324	9980	6232	140809	54205	55608	6570	5580	7832	64768	6558	55840	3301	5208	56904	26873	5909	5601	5731	50489	121053	647024	64089	375484	4773	389118	6725	84961	113263	22859	83444	53340	8309	9277	64222	30850	406	22845	55670	4170	211	29952	28982	91461	51272	29943	84858	23052	79080	83699	4615	5430	9564	83638	81030	222229	54996	1371	30844	3993	283899	37	3600	10383	2625	60412	1606	101	79571	1969	84163	10044	78990	7329	84722	23612	8633	55601	929	23623	112939	10561	1964	4240	94241	5652	4815	23287	29896	57132	54884	10857	9852	1959	9695	122616	3159	1612	7422	5986	170589	1039	4860	80148	79893	7097	8692	2643	54981	57576	5217	122769	126526	5154	51378	3123	116984	10614	84124	11009	84640	131583	9684	55715	51278	51222	8892	6737	7336	8451	2026	9001	50626	6773	202052	80152	11344	29126	124222	10212	79132	2769	79026	3373	80139	2681	83707	7855	56949	25806	79751	6836	54810	388324	7922	11240	6382	5270	5770	5372	9104	55884	526	2264	5153	55627	8061	1382	80781	54578	900	342667	162979	3304	2934	10955	85414	7975	1629	64393	10544	345611	387914	694	9638	6548	4599	375791	688	50999	51099	11155	10460	5495	400916	57622	51063	2959	65009	23654	84549	7739	5925	2021	1026	25911	6500	25819	7535	84747	81669	79088	8648	7262	7005	9446	239	10015	26151	217	26017	57535	1649	27342	56650	84557	9262	55599	63874	79710	255252	161424	23344	84153	2954	90407	55630	23203	55502	83593	11151	641372	23357	2065	3164	6714	339487	10840	5781	3281	210	10769	2956	57104	29842	11034	475	85477	3776	59344	4189	23528	11187	6659	350	4324	27090	55765	6274	114569	8694	51667	3712	80737	51255	529	7852	6347	130589	285761	4939	51734	9236	4600	1508	128989	113115	55032	5934	57467	8662	80256	4053	27242	51491	10938	126119	84861	83786	376497	286077	55003	285203	3566	359845	3295	284352	85474	140894	316	3074	3927	3202	2134	64224	90231	3959	90007	9518	3467	81532	5768	64112	7844	6442	56853	5606	84275	129607	10906	25809	10146	64410	80349	54498	6574	3691	56892	7353	231	9538	55135	10950	201626	9516	29789	28971	83552	27075	79637	80325	10120	201176	9136	64783	51234	339	81618	22955	9124	51042	26086	5692	1952	26094	114897	57405	29889	3976	55287	8817	85007	64943	60560	36	23637	81579	9973	55299	7402	55622	23169	132160	3140	158248	26998	26007	661	57799	2651	3619	23531	6271	10291	23567	10904	11043	57664	100130274	11152	100133941	56605	1476	4794	23452	26256	10611	6727	55806	79960	122060	10312	53840	22928	9645	64108	23411	7918	203	4712	1397	51759	11129	115207	389856	3669	51181	6909	375287	317719	3674	58538	6560	820	1839	11274	6809	87178	5442	10608	11261	2101	3037	2919	10951	8351	57570	29855	51163	3655	5268	92359	55716	11258	64432	66004	51559	170689	1609	9814	528	7156	5166	6047	3249	22924	29089	6337	355	6376	79165	3431	53342	9507	339390	8560	9050	5698	56262	158219	11153	84248	10572	51512	137075	402778	117246	1510	9600	1390	80004	85395	65109	9351	29901	345274	7277	9673	3430	51451	54107	51477	26118	9056	1308	54149	599	684	6535	9731	3801	80176	10263	84129	63826	4125	284119	2274	51092	8925	10777	10284	201134	146705	6051	11322	64135	6257	3718	2073	1760	64121	257236	7084	160622	150678	163732	3627	29902	10560	8879	29087	64114	51246	51573	5883	51439	26057	23463	6932	5734	611	54453	23400	83442	5936	5536	23456	11277	155066	4884	5911	4801	79641	55326	1601	23216	81577	780	5494	8505	7466	2639	3965	1440	1889	1647	112869	339231	3570	5339	26207	51614	10712	149371	25946	2937	23589	8408	80765	339122	79086	79573	4286	81786	2941	57787	271	57465	768239	10577	8847	64065	993	9394	2939	968	11235	27433	3726	51637	85415	10960	9130	29115	121457	91614	5464	9080	30000	91543	23382	7594	5036	29928	4524	2799	126328	56848	148811	9401	83667	79038	2752	5959	2819	79017	816	58488	26586	29942	2990	51526	219855	3835	9730	6623	137964	10018	4940	8324	732206	90933	78992	64422	54737	399665	84933	11064	6284	84261	23179	57506	340719	8562	2123	83541	8784	23645	57605	28976	2014	10105	55964	9514	1514	414328	949	3265	7803	9114	1677	374618	28984	127933	123	9641	3852	127544	55142	3612	1384	79670	5371	3437	10765	51382	131601	2822	8751	79717	9883	10589	81559	126961	822	54659	2110	201562	9261	91966	64837	55593	339665	9911	6772	55266	2184	283377	3428	3425	5155	81537	85463	6472	23598	56181	11138	9604	3664	84649	6697	79706	79094	7378	84447	10110	2180	26056

Impairment of the complex regulatory network of cell death and survival is frequently the reason for therapy resistance of breast cancer cells and a major cause of tumor progression. We established two independent cell lines from a fast growing mouse breast tumor (WAP-SVT/t transgenic animal). Cells from one line (ME-A cells) are sensitive to apoptotic stimuli such as growth factor depletion or treatment with antitumor agents (e.g. doxorubicin). Cells from the second line (ME-C cells), which carry a missense mutation at the p53 codon 242, are very insensitive to apoptotic stimuli. Co-cultivation experiments revealed that the ME-C cells mediate cell death resistance to the ME-A cells. Microarray and Western blot analysis showed that osteopontin (OPN) is selectively overexpressed by the ME-C cells. This glycoprotein is the most abundant protein secreted by the ME-C cells and we obtained strong indications that OPN is the main antiapoptotic factor. However, the OPN containing ME-C cell medium does not alter the expression level of pro- or antiapoptotic genes or known inhibitors of apoptosis (IAPs). Its signaling involves mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) kinase (MEK)1/2 as the kinase inhibitor PD98059 restores apoptosis but not the Akt inhibitor. In the ME-A cells, mitochondrial cytochrome c release occurs with and without external apoptotic stimuli. OPN containing ME-C cell medium does not prevent the mitochondrial cytochrome c release and caspase-9 processing. In serum starved ME-A cells, the OPN containing ME-C cell medium prevents caspase-3 activation. However, in doxorubicin-treated cells, although apoptosis is blocked, it does not inhibit caspase-3. This indicates that the ME-A cells distinguish between the initial apoptotic stimuli and that the cells possess a further uncharacterized control element acting downstream from

Impairment of the complex regulatory network of cell death and survival is frequently the reason for therapy resistance of breast cancer cells and a major cause of tumor progression. We established two independent cell lines from a fast growing mouse breast tumor (WAP-SVT/t transgenic animal). Cells from one line (ME-A cells) are sensitive to apoptotic stimuli such as growth factor depletion or treatment with antitumor agents (e.g. doxorubicin). Cells from the second line (ME-C cells), which carry a missense mutation at the p53 codon 242, are very insensitive to apoptotic stimuli. Co-cultivation experiments revealed that the ME-C cells mediate cell death resistance to the ME-A cells. Microarray and Western blot analysis showed that osteopontin (OPN) is selectively overexpressed by the ME-C cells. This glycoprotein is the most abundant protein secreted by the ME-C cells and we obtained strong indications that OPN is the main antiapoptotic factor. However, the OPN containing ME-C cell medium does not alter the expression level of pro- or antiapoptotic genes or known inhibitors of apoptosis (IAPs). Its signaling involves mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) kinase (MEK)1/2 as the kinase inhibitor PD98059 restores apoptosis but not the Akt inhibitor. In the ME-A cells, mitochondrial cytochrome c release occurs with and without external apoptotic stimuli. OPN containing ME-C cell medium does not prevent the mitochondrial cytochrome c release and caspase-9 processing. In serum starved ME-A cells, the OPN containing ME-C cell medium prevents caspase-3 activation. However, in doxorubicin-treated cells, although apoptosis is blocked, it does not inhibit caspase-3. This indicates that the ME-A cells distinguish between the initial apoptotic stimuli and that the cells possess a further uncharacterized control element acting downstream from caspase-3.					55287	3164	58476	5317	10263	402682	8575	5883	10560	4860	84693	1629	10018	80320	79751	6570	1062	284352	2746	22928	57467	11240	375287	6483	7097	51181	55326	1949	5495	6120	84304	2232	340348	5925	2799	339231	140809	29942	66004	649	90407	29089	3674	5601	317649	56904	1601	1959	7318	5339	29842	79589	10044	25994	6722	9197	51099	64065	3927	286077	150275	11344	29943	2184	3265	4193	2517	3635	5129	3965	56181	7135	85007	79641	63826	83442	6051	219855	5816	283991	2625	271	114990	728229	10611	146705	7087	122769	80139	1785	54784	5372	11277	27075	768239	2819	10868	5017	3300	3417	114294	2014	83892	23654	9638	79152	10401	84557	2959	11064	57799	79038	3600	10284	3570	140894	2907	7286	29902	1316	283229	84282	9641	5744	223082	1760	79627	1616	6574	1397	84153	6472	30844	2110	445	6932	124222	79637	4814	5442	316	3425	10156	641372	4884	26086	9926	2354	26119	65009	51255	3431	83638	5972	7052	5494	51573	56853	130814	124540	51092	55630	1677	91461	23287	2021	51426	317	10458	2934	81559	10809	239	57679	2052	51382	23452	10362	388228	4125	3852	10840	8543	5217	3664	10105	2954	8784	115265	79710	26207	23005	60560	254170	900	22845	116984	90634	3295	1371	8648	3467	123096	339	54677	9538	6535	55032	4524	816	5911	81537	9124	3976	3123	84722	64114	3691	6257	91966	10777	126526	26256	10906	23400	155066	780	4189	23637	9980	6548	201163	3281	1508	8324	51559	115207	7832	993	387914	54101	55200	9056	5228	83699	130589	6382	80152	5268	79671	10951	4600	7515	84124	533	51063	9730	23645	29948	2302	101	3304	5731	5912	3655	91614	64359	6786	11151	2939	4775	134492	63874	128209	10978	6652	7803	117178	80349	939	4097	23531	80325	25829	8817	647024	55299	11267	11145	1606	26499	8309	138050	8351	163732	375791	4846	10247	205	9695	29984	22919	54659	1200	115330	10437	3291	10314	2822	9659	25865	23406	355	6094	26292	122616	7329	5781	2026	9351	2990	134728	79041	51184	51378	92815	79094	968	22925	3959	55544	55135	7477	63893	10960	11155	1869	51702	23528	1384	23062	8775	80781	22924	29952	11173	3706	10807	28955	9114	7422	83463	1609	9262	6836	3074	8692	201299	57542	55062	55502	23052	283446	23612	23623	81786	1572	6643	11322	822	79086	11138	26227	9649	421	83667	7739	154	27034	55829	30968	10544	83593	5536	1302	285761	6623	350	5154	23463	22949	8659	29901	26007	11132	26056	255252	5648	83637	79567	2134	399665	203	2956	90637	90780	339390	949	9973	1852	2941	64222	339122	57405	10573	64089	9646	60626	128989	285203	57570	24142	51272	9401	115399	57026	126328	3728	7855	22954	23175	80318	58488	5986	9394	148811	4324	10460	22795	7852	100130274	3337	79026	80765	1376	8216	84129	9814	6274	84649	1948	6909	54498	84747	3993	30850	27090	25907	9935	26586	57465	6768	7111	131583	10955	26094	9244	85415	2073	256302	29087	26751	1947	5166	131601	54453	3712	11212	50848	1612	8847	51449	55332	54996	5770	170589	58538	83541	26998	231	85474	126961	283377	26057	202052	5934	7277	9766	6468	23357	26017	9099	319	9514	150678	25776	51768	23598	644096	28971	8832	340719	1476	149371	11328	402778	475	7464	11187	8581	6324	84861	10608	10146	79960	1604	845	3633	6809	25809	11020	3606	6772	9130	9618	3202	162979	83786	25946	79165	3029	27433	26873	7043	92715	376497	55608	8398	6284	23218	5547	64129	113263	9883	5528	201176	137964	64393	22955	7402	340485	51734	81572	8451	3249	129303	3162	83742	55364	51512	653121	60412	94241	9518	57605	9600	10723	211	84961	1153	10417	9564	1317	611	345611	51614	7844	217	23234	23589	5155	64422	25876	114897	57535	1026	9355	8408	84858	10577	1942	3671	2937	121457	26151	23456	55266	53340	148713	132160	5580	1889

Impairment of the complex regulatory network of cell death and survival is frequently the reason for therapy resistance of breast cancer cells and a major cause of tumor progression. We established two independent cell lines from a fast growing mouse breast tumor (WAP-SVT/t transgenic animal). Cells from one line (ME-A cells) are sensitive to apoptotic stimuli such as growth factor depletion or treatment with antitumor agents (e.g. doxorubicin). Cells from the second line (ME-C cells), which carry a missense mutation at the p53 codon 242, are very insensitive to apoptotic stimuli. Co-cultivation experiments revealed that the ME-C cells mediate cell death resistance to the ME-A cells. Microarray and Western blot analysis showed that osteopontin (OPN) is selectively overexpressed by the ME-C cells. This glycoprotein is the most abundant protein secreted by the ME-C cells and we obtained strong indications that OPN is the main antiapoptotic factor. However, the OPN containing ME-C cell medium does not alter the expression level of pro- or antiapoptotic genes or known inhibitors of apoptosis (IAPs). Its signaling involves mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) kinase (MEK)1/2 as the kinase inhibitor PD98059 restores apoptosis but not the Akt inhibitor. In the ME-A cells, mitochondrial cytochrome c release occurs with and without external apoptotic stimuli. OPN containing ME-C cell medium does not prevent the mitochondrial cytochrome c release and caspase-9 processing. In serum starved ME-A cells, the OPN containing ME-C cell medium prevents caspase-3 activation. However, in doxorubicin-treated cells, although apoptosis is blocked, it does not inhibit caspase-3. This indicates that the ME-A cells distinguish between the initial apoptotic stimuli and that the cells possess a further uncharacterized control element acting downstream from caspase-3.					30846	3257	8737	4893	9986	7064	64418	80207	11266	5889	3661	2166	57678	220134	57216	9238	8800	55892	25896	847	5981	2768	51465	3839	158747	9839	57472	728294	5025	57551	84514	8914	6156	11101	55578	9584	9774	6426	375444	391356	8473	26519	54995	91	83480	84128	9552	9275	2764	144577	79084	5411	3177	55015	27131	10528	5156	7469	116224	7327	5355	5394	23443	59269	9321	113178	10452	7112	80317	5289	3607	84320	1066	9569	9975	6508	56683	112479	4507	79977	4234	54676	26520	83879	10971	51164	6745	5886	57649	3949	114112	338917	11269	10613	64328	23607	10625	51542	9590	51805	5501	56125	2305	92399	7323	26093	1562	55795	2064	22794	79897	6102	9341	221143	7072	55520	11335	6944	84928	7083	7534	1990	2002	7703	284307	23741	79888	708	79577	84236	55746	84324	388581	91433	10204	203197	23683	9818	51317	11168	51268	79618	1973	8880	665	3601	3572	54487	10490	342945	134429	6788	389362	26064	64083	221927	27085	5717	80777	65108	3597	145553	23291	10495	55968	3396	23640	283951	8870	6352	8440	55101	5519	114034	4853	80862	84062	23557	5255	51053	84461	10550	23595	150159	11179	81627	51564	51111	84823	3652	197370	57630	1375	84792	10657	10951	7570	4363	54901	5756	51631	388536	617	8725	26275	56647	51122	85025	9807	6059	10056	6431	23001	51304	25998	3376	80335	55023	22	89978	85409	10899	382	55775	3980	9204	79689	1070	3312	9180	56970	51303	8028	92400	8839	9993	10063	9221	10772	221545	57650	8106	2037	1316	7186	58480	3609	1627	221527	79834	9545	347733	124454	6839	4848	54465	84274	3837	51315	10469	1478	10195	1457	10714	79156	7525	10211	26123	51231	4678	9987	4478	3092	203068	9213	1453	164	79101	80155	85007	3178	126731	55296	9325	10165	2395	55553	3551	27042	55975	84146	79447	23076	3678	5338	127018	4171	5195	2029	23150	84167	50717	27252	5933	11243	9521	4609	81490	7375	27010	79735	55901	860	6950	79629	65260	54892	3344	2107	255919	9557	10621	84934	25913	2859	9470	2936	4489	1718	2664	7541	1723	51602	79724	100129361	64087	84276	58516	8220	60685	6502	1660	9736	51227	23013	51654	79068	23371	30834	29985	80185	7756	55915	10979	64327	10733	11167	5424	4133	7866	9319	6897	6248	26121	55596	10927	4907	84309	84327	92799	23404	55082	25942	1798	199746	22887	54976	55872	7812	25921	29078	6240	6767	5423	55250	54929	10588	196383	129685	26608	64788	140890	22985	57587	23085	27241	339521	54780	79091	8932	599	2584	2997	990	9853	51706	115024	4802	2072	246243	25880	22868	27338	51013	51309	7078	10785	116461	6364	5819	2355	84197	9730	26574	7298	26190	1108	1725	8507	134637	27043	27292	2241	4781	6432	54534	79673	6934	170506	9039	51088	9962	4682	3308	9410	26091	10199	3268	4782	1829	9898	11183	399909	2017	284161	3191	4771	6397	29945	23378	8625	23195	11128	60528	9063	58477	4855	27086	79144	284406	51259	10797	128338	2150	9871	10270	5832	6868	9991	51333	55007	10038	57559	8091	79774	54557	9933	509	705	63979	128869	1787	84172	8161	9643	6427	6171	26003	159013	29066	6776	64798	10914	6993	861	10915	1468	55850	7988	8904	8650	26995	11188	5887	23315	50813	4595	22995	23509	5451	6259	10095	23529	5471	10025	64969	10287	56915	339366	2805	10626	60314	10465	55505	1974	91894	4983	6309	9753	5792	960	284004	63915	55851	11222	10492	55254	55671	84171	26528	23243	55127	9801	57449	154007	8894	3275	123016	84720	10040	8835	6821	55110	644076	696	23269	6605	641638	22902	6182	6949	119032	10628	64983	64838	9865	2648	55312	57143	5089	5438	10380	9306	51514	10100	7181	9512	64841	10322	90871	6929	1615	1051	79736	57602	7408	328	10902	5063	22858	57761	65095	6777	25803	64429	51651	8446	7162	55609	1662	22905	1545	84626	1975	24147	80222	394	51322	43	9817	4254	1678	143187	54987	29843	60	10282	128239	22903	53916	4200	8405	55750	5867	8487	80031	1054	51132	64743	3554	5609	79833	9482	79574	23036	55179	10799	10084	2618	84230	4076	92922	8241	57002	6742	2673	662	10606	2650	4919	23536	84188	119392	3070	7037	57697	10989	10042	10459	22823	10254	55217	23016	79947	3930	6670	3054	25974	84612	124808	113235	7023	29107	51504	7170	81929	23326	5595	257160	54788	607	84952	51742	54536	85313	153339	5426	10171	11186	5877	51018	25885	11161	1841	647979	5188	322	9562	55802	64755	8624	22926	7770	375748	29883	11102	9304	602	85406	79081	5359	28960	79077	84233	6122	95681	94081	10438	7189	2653	5802	4437	84955	11201	2794	3145	10741	10947	468	4345	9278	5127	1479	4216	201266	8898	5876	4188	6709	196403	9639	494143	10526	5160	3313	11099	8089	114883	10514	10221	53615	7701	23590	10059	1017	5425	80772	1266	125950	401505

Several parameters like cell growth, cell cycling capacity, apoptotic behavior and growth transformation were investigated under physiological and stress conditions. Co-transfected cells displayed the highest resistance against apoptotic triggers, cell cycling capacity and loss-of-contact inhibition. These analyses were complemented by gene expression profiling experiments and specific gene signatures were established for each of the three cell lines. Interestingly, co-transfected cells strongly upregulate the homeobox gene Nanog. In combination with Oct4, the Nanog homeoprotein is steering maintenance of pluripotency and self-renewal in embryonic stem cells. Transcription of Nanog and other stem cell factors, like Oct4 and Bmi1, was verified in biopsy material of t(4;11) patient cells which express both reciprocal t(4;11) fusion genes. In conclusion, the presence of both reciprocal MLL fusion proteins confers biological properties known from t(4;11) leukemia, suggesting that each of the two fusion proteins contribute specific properties and, in combination, also synergistic effects to the leukemic phenotype.					167153	26086	8708	7092	25764	8241	10274	84981	11250	202	79633	254251	729275	79634	10497	220965	6416	78992	4891	23368	169792	5713	27010	5866	51290	9877	55504	89	84417	3955	51133	9990	83699	256471	23406	55119	7006	5571	1289	253461	5991	202243	1452	4690	283349	64960	3672	56851	199857	25854	115004	4222	768	11180	140609	388695	3454	153527	27071	89846	8722	84988	23143	64359	7078	1112	23646	23037	55023	7161	5611	83595	5339	30	85301	4739	1758	6774	23161	663	4820	54617	11278	55914	7547	155368	5744	7358	5137	55749	25766	2324	81831	5187	10410	23248	23576	4794	55815	9351	439921	89801	9184	147991	7534	8519	51285	6382	10015	7569	4214	91408	10611	676	389792	51661	5328	26018	6932	1374	10763	84272	1788	7323	10232	1353	22862	10435	27175	84078	26224	813	22827	6239	6095	26229	11183	22908	220416	144811	55005	51510	9071	29850	55506	10336	8899	9804	79893	1876	10290	6925	167838	6210	11322	9295	9147	54757	5290	3627	256949	6224	2583	9960	9252	23175	378938	55033	5789	4760

In conclusion, the presence of both reciprocal MLL fusion proteins confers biological properties known from t(4;11) leukemia, suggesting that each of the two fusion proteins contribute specific properties and, in combination, also synergistic effects to the leukemic phenotype.					80312	130574	10537	10610	55236	23293	81553	4920	5454	1501	126961	254295	10736	79155	54587	57586	23089	23500	79827	84867	399693	10158	962	728780	5355	9557	80740	85480	27065	25789	80325	9258	23682	9246	101	54857	9227	9413	133418	11055	23208	285148	22890	8540	3479	51136	10411	145814	4781	883	873	5026	2919	51170	83988	2596	56907	9127	10721	5412	387758	10194	1965	116535	2786	80343	4329	8125	4856	64130	116039	79845	126	114904	114902	56262	54496	100289255	116843	654502	153222	958	132014	51763	1548	283	192134	744	90550	64900	256281	1836	1959	100505576	23283	8718	23732	351	27239	7421	56253	23022	286828	1050	10466	90835	92235	129080	4909	7994	146456	10988	3698	5592	3514	123606	5968	4258	245940	59	146439	257194	114815	56940	5649	51008	1114	5800	90427	4692	127428	1545	5164	8284	6403	642843	10923	2201	7345	4799	25	11343	84950	7057	284	23080	6251	51534	10533	149499	5082	4988	1572	127391	9828	7363	54843	10079	219670	9543	340146	143686	26576	6619	51639	10551	54852	1056	10894	140688	10417	253738	9705	55619	362	81704	2564	114907	9168	100287898	55833	127281	54839	54443	79639	131669	84824	79923	51162	29994	55212	55314	400745	56853	201229	83552	11067	29906	441478	122706	4137	7267	140578	84159	154865	94025	5774	79625	2035	51248	51135	718	5947	57758	9678	94234	10438	4802	10268	64111	2140	1184	50846	387849	8404	4319	9249	93166	2302	26064	164153	125150	389125	2045	55425	4763	9321	1400

The reciprocal chromosomal translocation t(4;11) is correlated with infant, childhood, adult and therapy-related high-risk acute leukemia. Here, we investigated the biological effects of MLL.AF4, AF4.MLL or the combination of both reciprocal fusion proteins in a conditional in vitro cell culture model system. Several parameters like cell growth, cell cycling capacity, apoptotic behavior and growth transformation were investigated under physiological and stress conditions. Co-transfected cells displayed the highest resistance against apoptotic triggers, cell cycling capacity and loss-of-contact inhibition. These analyses were complemented by gene expression profiling experiments and specific gene signatures were established for each of the three cell lines. Interestingly, co-transfected cells strongly upregulate the homeobox gene Nanog. In combination with Oct4, the Nanog homeoprotein is steering maintenance of pluripotency and self-renewal in embryonic stem cells. Transcription of Nanog and other stem cell factors, like Oct4 and Bmi1, was verified in biopsy material of t(4;11) patient cells which express both reciprocal t(4;11) fusion genes.

We have used microarray technology to identify the transcriptional targets of Rho subfamily guanosine 5'-triphosphate (GTP)ases in NIH3T3 cells. This analysis indicated that murine fibroblasts transformed by these proteins show similar transcriptomal profiles. Functional annotation of the regulated genes indicate that Rho subfamily GTPases target a wide spectrum of functions, although loci encoding proteins linked to proliferation and DNA synthesis/transcription are upregulated preferentially. Rho proteins promote four main networks of interacting proteins nucleated around E2F, c-Jun, c-Myc and p53. Of those, E2F, c-Jun and c-Myc are essential for the maintenance of cell transformation. Inhibition of Rock, one of the main Rho GTPase targets, leads to small changes in the transcriptome of Rho-transformed cells. Rock inhibition decreases c-myc gene expression without affecting the E2F and c-Jun pathways. Loss-of-function studies demonstrate that c-Myc is important for the blockage of cell-contact inhibition rather than for promoting the proliferation of Rho-transformed cells. However, c-Myc overexpression does not bypass the inhibition of cell transformation induced by Rock blockage, indicating that c-Myc is essential, but not sufficient, for Rock-dependent transformation. These results reveal the complexity of the genetic program orchestrated by the Rho subfamily and pinpoint protein networks that mediate different aspects of the malignant phenotype of Rho-transformed cells.					1647	4489	358	51635	7078	51170	1036	28959	55365	2632	51450	25791	216	56925	1649	9975	5156	5376	1634

The Promyelocytic Leukaemia gene product PML plays an important role in cell growth and survival, and resides in discrete subnuclear structures called Nuclear Bodies (NB). We performed comparative analysis of the expression of 40 Myc target genes and of Myc binding to their regulatory regions both in wild-type and PML knockout cells. We demonstrate that if PML is absent, despite Myc binding to the DNA regulatory sequences is unchanged, the expression profile of several Myc target genes is altered. PML is largely involved in gene regulation, via recruitment of several transcription factors and cofactors to the NB. Consistently, we show that Myc partially localizes to the NB and physically interacts with PML, and that this localization depends on Myc expression levels. As deregulation occurs to both activated and repressed Myc target genes, we propose that PML influences Myc transcriptional activity through a mechanism that involves the control of Myc post-translational modifications.					4691	661	8454	891	83879	8886	993	83939	790	1019	5757	4904	586	7057	4869	4953	2012	3398	894	7157	1977	7083	581

Upregulation of HER2/ErbB2/Neu occurs in 15-30% of human breast cancers and correlates with poor prognosis. Identification of ErbB2/Neu transcriptional targets should facilitate development of novel therapeutic approaches. Development of breast cancer is a multistep process; thus, to identify the transcriptomes associated with different stages of progression of tumorigenesis, we compared expression profiles of mammary tumors and preneoplastic mammary tissue from MMTV-Neu transgenic mice to expression profiles of wild-type mammary glands using Affymetrix microarrays. We identified 324 candidate genes that were unique to ErbB2/Neu-induced tumors relative to normal mammary gland tissue from wild-type controls. Expression of a subset of these genes (82) was also changed in the preneoplastic mammary glands compared to wild-type controls, indicating that they may play a pivotal role during early events of ErbB2/Neu-initiated mammary tumorigenesis. Further analysis of the microarray data revealed that expression of several known transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta target genes was altered, suggesting that the TGF-beta signaling cascade is downregulated in ErbB2/Neu-induced tumors. Western blot analysis for TGF-beta-Receptor-I/ALK5 and immunohistochemistry for TGF-beta-Receptor-I/ALK5 and phosphorylated/activated Smad2 confirmed that the Smad-dependent TGF-beta signaling cascade was inactive in these tumors. Although absent in most of the tumor, phosphorylated Smad2 was present in the periphery of tumors. Interestingly, presence of phosphorylated/activated Smad2 correlated with expression of Activin-Receptor-IB/ALK4, suggesting that although Smad-dependent TGF-beta signaling is absent in ErbB2/Neu-induced tumors, Activin signaling may be active at the leading edge of these tumors. Cumulatively, these data indicate that the TGF-beta pathway is intrinsically suppressed in ErbB2/Neu tumors via a mechanism involving loss of TGF-beta-Receptor-I/ALK5.					349633	3398	529	84747	5955	92597	6558	8835	1075	4072	9208	8543	7164	55884	57619	928	3482	1633	9592	26298	84299	230	3980	1365	2919	55640	7494	1534	22936	6659	2530	57648	55500	55342	54463	7430	56172	51186	202	9479	5754	25978	7465	5771	27347	3998	1488	6692	23286	7286	27090	23423	1611	3732	1465	56925	3164	1848	3709	80148	50848	128240	1500	2030	2065	288	3934	10890	55907	7039	84418	55740	2115	7103	6242	64083	5500	56005	9618	6500	55294	9061	10955	3783	9455	400506	65268	58527	27230	284996	2182	1829	2245	10040	768239	3340	9331	26207	7022	54206	9516	81	2591	1656	7421	3636	9532	2348	1111	122060	6728	805	7074	523	8869	22931	6709	29095	5349	3664	1796	57650	8870	10682	6241	255743	2317	9601	57228	4292	51188	4925	51599	55854	391059	79191	2152	28970	595	8738	7503	7163	983	10159	3856	64065	5530	9590	1366	85462

These results reveal the complexity of the genetic program orchestrated by the Rho subfamily and pinpoint protein networks that mediate different aspects of the malignant phenotype of Rho-transformed cells.					2098	29074	7398	7070	25804	10460	619563	2146	54888	10963	84154	7283	10452	1763	7443	2817	10063	10189	1478	7301	58516	26524	5743	339665	26586	5597	6426	3776	10591	5983	2286	117246	5111	3164	1105	1948	51154	133	2303	1503	56945	55651	5557	5742	10051	51512	5424	5693	3070	7083	7272	55795	64432	8208	8061	908	5090	221061	134492	23594	5464	9446	29089	6648	51703	3655	7027	10276	23435	26355	345611	7782	5277	7422	58490	4879	6182	9868	1969	7187	9768	4891	5819	10733	51550	1024	9319	26136	8502	57650	23468	5223	79081	134218	5902	84916	5427	79733	10054	286826	1111	23327	55327	3918	6790	54205	5719	92521	7167	3619	11243	1843	3148	11073	64093	3149	54700	83879	9493	10229	81624	10856	84153	6470	1026	4953	4836	7203	51096	54433	6888	10951	4085	11004	221545	55143	10556	55723	10607	9173	3925	22822	1894	28959	55365	8091	22918	3481	960	136	2317	2668	51602	9184	2870	646	55544	259266	4065	83443	1039	552900	2820	2618	5359	5036	1839	10112	9688	54443	4609	9097	9555	595	10762	55038	983	1869	10055	1073	9188	25791	10969	4613	6633	3939	1719	7114	55173	55847	3251	5717	8318	3832	29968	2710	10808	4193	8669	4176	10635	5329	63979	7407	58	23246	9156	50626	8914	10171	5905	672	22936	1164	861	1633	120534	1852	10188	23223	5481	25979	8819	5211	4998	25906	6004	8407	201161	10592	79101	10946	4436	54908	57157	255743	10797	1687	3843	25994	1729	11169	9124	29107	1841	29078	2273	9410	10061	27000	132001	90637	205428	7057	90102	55320	286827	10040	359845	5569	890	7139	3433	6634	22928	1647	10769	54478	51182	54780	26156	1678	5888	10509	1182	87178	10436	2305	3015	51053	6723	81	5682	3930	84549	84230	59338	55388	4839	581	27063	7128	10535	130814	191	9100	4478	214	54948	54801	23234	9232	3035	11332	10471	1786	55622	4174	9212	2919	64388	6059	6354	7965	3725	86	1459	83743	8662	891	7157	8870	1295	10921	6749	10123	72	9748	9208	991	1848	8038	4172	8815	8317	358	7295	23169	7056	5434	64981	6372	23401	2288	3320	4173	53371	84617	9055	9637	5817	54893	1809	7514	51203	23597	27101	4605	4171	55037	29128	7430	51377	5876	9975	6627	10527	55783	5791	3838	2091	10625	7913	8436	29127	7112	84908	23212	2697	4811	5688	7037	4686	54726	6876	494115	87	306	56902	23649	899	586	1912	23397	10432	7371	10574	7296	27258	23603	100287932	3329	134266	9538	113130	11321	54969	900	28232	990	10580	7050	4288	8892	4751	7153	9994	22824	55536	4830	23414	81620	977	6513	57122	84844	6240	5558	64332	9933	51575	54206	2107	822	5321	8520	9787	3491	128239	669	6117	1965	3978	6941	6696	5933	27346	2632	23160	3624	23082	80155	9314	836	2730	8671	5985	3837	8886	5917	4792	401152	5734	483	24137	55379	3097	26472	1140	3692	79366	3308	1490	4803	79902	58472	83903	2597	8531	51728	10915	6632	5654	25941	54463	2069	5691	5984	5701	3037	997	705	4678	51514	7866	8726	64425	332	7076	2936	54820	4682	5422	3371	55071	5054	6347	10544	6760	54962	10728	439	3835	627	51691	57007	51567	3099	1104	2237	9595	3475	1434	83541	5230	5445	699	23512	7884	3489	10232	79077	1163	995	1058	57819

We have used microarray technology to identify the transcriptional targets of Rho subfamily guanosine 5'-triphosphate (GTP)ases in NIH3T3 cells. This analysis indicated that murine fibroblasts transformed by these proteins show similar transcriptomal profiles. Functional annotation of the regulated genes indicate that Rho subfamily GTPases target a wide spectrum of functions, although loci encoding proteins linked to proliferation and DNA synthesis/transcription are upregulated preferentially. Rho proteins promote four main networks of interacting proteins nucleated around E2F, c-Jun, c-Myc and p53. Of those, E2F, c-Jun and c-Myc are essential for the maintenance of cell transformation. Inhibition of Rock, one of the main Rho GTPase targets, leads to small changes in the transcriptome of Rho-transformed cells. Rock inhibition decreases c-myc gene expression without affecting the E2F and c-Jun pathways. Loss-of-function studies demonstrate that c-Myc is important for the blockage of cell-contact inhibition rather than for promoting the proliferation of Rho-transformed cells. However, c-Myc overexpression does not bypass the inhibition of cell transformation induced by Rock blockage, indicating that c-Myc is essential, but not sufficient, for Rock-dependent transformation. These results reveal the complexity of the genetic program orchestrated by the Rho subfamily and pinpoint protein networks that mediate different aspects of the malignant phenotype of Rho-transformed cells.					7204	2585	10628	6400	6405	92675	6709	5118	3908	55577	2260	2149	92154	83719	9158	2019	1292	8425	3306	1374	23635	51661	4008	6038	28981	9445	3727	7421	7498	827	647087	1634	26286	2619	7291	51112	2629	53917	10540	57153	103910	11346	54985	5376	4335	10659	2934	2621	5156	5159	1291	60681	6591	10916	6810	8788	51804	51374	961	6913	4731	51031	5270	8745	1195	25798	6342	7078	5806	4700	7941	2907	2058	4256	51474	9554	57523	51439	4781	23646	6925	9545	1545	11015	80762	138151	5106	4323	4128	7058	1500	340371	10906	54982	3671	5166	25874	1200	80381	8404	4015	5187	3572	51614	128240	1528	112770	9528	1595	5295	22924	2799	91860	4597	100133941	170463	4784	10043	34	202	4860	11337	253725	4082	535	23175	10478	151887	10567	3417	7580	10724	2946	1266	3965	715	9500	670	285440	28956	309	23741	1993	165	1879	288	54407	5311	5272	57017	381	5333	83439	1287	4665	6811	4040	10156	3400	54996	10404	8434	50717	3983	5914	1036	3910	2620	114876	6443	4047	133418	8321	10410	9114	8766	5621	51019	9180	84693	5783	57462	7328	81621	6146	6711	64094	5660	5264	51523	5805	5834	374882	84284	5954	81631	4642	51008	10577	166	1466	6624	4124	23283	8573	22872	6423	6767	10586	50865	4489	4267	6237	1176	2954	55740	2593	11328	11244	27243	154796	523	857	51170	6558	60	10003	51637	1277	23326	10631	55904	334	1757	4883	57446	27250	6595	5476	4651	6387	4259	5939	22920	6920	27044	5797	5360	3913	84293	150737	9367	79001	8869	3399	79971	1822	4969	5900	1666	9741	55076	4925	4837	6892	1293	4147	10007	201895	410	58476	27122	2277	1611	3920	7067	2887	727957	10608	7589	1278	3398	3020	23765	216	842	1289	29952	22809	56917	22933	55502	8878	6510	1902	5025	10484	84557	51768	9902	1759	2771	4668	57175	55850	57226	1465	53635	8613	2690	57035	253738	1211	6483	7267	51450	146198	2335	2941	6464	1649	23557	23270	7423	5218	3300	115557	8913	3709	57544	81618	23423	23608	10106	687	2294	3988	56925	9140	10333	4502	6284	2239	186	5869	51160	8082	54453	6774	9451	2947	55384	3429	5728	27244	51226	6391	5327	307	4982	5019	6376	5530	23062	8553	27072	8639	9590	1717	2548	2263	987	84299	51668	10401	4091	6495	773	1891	57591	51635	4331	10330	4211	2896	7507	5463	4060	64121	79718	1281	901	3157	129303

Retroviral tagging previously identified putative cancer-causing genes in a mouse brain tumor model where a recombinant Moloney murine leukemia virus encoding the platelet-derived growth factor B-chain (MMLV/PDGFB) was intracerebrally injected in newborn mice. In the present study, expression analysis using cDNA arrays revealed several similarities of virus-induced mouse gliomas with human brain tumors. Brain tumors with short latency contained on average 8.0 retroviral insertions and resembled human glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) whereas long-latency gliomas were of lower grade, similar to human oligodendroglioma (OD) and had 2.3 insertions per tumor. Several known and novel genes of tumor progression or cell markers were differentially expressed between OD- and GBM-like tumors. Array and quantitative real-time PCR analysis demonstrated elevated expression similar to Pdgfralpha of retrovirally tagged genes Abhd2, Ddr1, Fos, Ng2, Ppfibp1, Rad51b and Sulf2 in both glioma types compared to neonatal and adult normal brain. The retrovirally tagged genes Plekhb1, Prex1, Prkg2, Sox10 and 1200004M23Rik were upregulated in the tumors but had a different expression profile than Pdgfralpha whereas Rap1gap, Gli1, Neurl and Camk2b were downregulated in the tumors.

Expression microarray analysis identified over 930 genes regulated during puberty in the mouse mammary gland. Most prominent were genes whose expression increased in parallel with pubertal development and remained high thereafter. Members of the Wnt, transforming growth factor-beta and oestrogen-signalling pathways were significantly overrepresented. Comparison to expression data from CITED1 knockout mice identified a subset of oestrogen-responsive genes displaying altered expression in the absence of CITED1. Included in this subset are stanniocalcin2 (Stc2) and amphiregulin (Areg). Chromatin immunoprecipitation revealed that ERalpha binds to oestrogen response elements in both the Stc2 and Areg genes in the mammary gland during puberty.

Expression microarray analysis identified over 930 genes regulated during puberty in the mouse mammary gland. Most prominent were genes whose expression increased in parallel with pubertal development and remained high thereafter. Members of the Wnt, transforming growth factor-beta and oestrogen-signalling pathways were significantly overrepresented. Comparison to expression data from CITED1 knockout mice identified a subset of oestrogen-responsive genes displaying altered expression in the absence of CITED1. Included in this subset are stanniocalcin2 (Stc2) and amphiregulin (Areg). Chromatin immunoprecipitation revealed that ERalpha binds to oestrogen response elements in both the Stc2 and Areg genes in the mammary gland during puberty. Additionally, CITED1 and ERalpha localize to the same epithelial cells of the pubertal mammary gland, supporting a role for interaction of these two proteins during normal development. In a human breast cancer data set, expression of Stc2, Areg and CITED1 parallel that of ERalpha. Similar to ERalpha, CITED1 expression correlates with good outcome in breast cancer, implying that potential maintenance of the ERalpha-CITED1 co-regulated signalling pathway in breast tumours can indicate good prognosis.					211	4791	1491	5354	244	6204	3417	7079	3240	4774	100505381	3507	4826	4155	8204	4729	51155	2170	5997	1346	3932	5066	6173	6227	645638	348035	3486	604	4267	51422	10487	1026	6932	6129	23379	56997	57544	9750	92840

Hematopoiesis, the process by which mature blood cells arise, is controlled by multiple transcription factors, which act in stage- and lineage-specific complexes. It is a major goal to elucidate the genes regulated by these transcription factors, in order to obtain a full understanding of the process and its malignant counterpart, leukemia. Myb family transcription factors play a central role in hematopoiesis. To identify new Myb family target genes, we have used an inducible dominant-negative protein for a subtraction cloning protocol in a model cell system (FDCP-Mix) with many characteristics of normal hematopoiesis. We present here a novel group of 29 validated Myb family target genes of diverse functions.					10469	6574	839	6782	6510	10576	8379	340481	5250	6418	3312	8535	87	329	8539	54888	83641	8826	1211	1314	51106	51272	4478	22797	963	22872	84034	23550	5530

Chemical induction of squamous tumors in the mouse skin induces multiple benign papillomas: high-frequency terminally benign low-risk papillomas and low-frequency high-risk papillomas, the putative precursor lesions to squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). We have compared the gene expression profile of twenty different early low- and high-risk papillomas with normal skin and SCC. Unsupervised clustering of 514 differentially expressed genes (P<0.001) showed that 9/10 high-risk papillomas clustered with SCC, while 1/10 clustered with low-risk papillomas, and this correlated with keratin markers of tumor progression. Prediction analysis for microarrays (PAM) identified 87 genes that distinguished the two papilloma classes, and a majority of these had a similar expression pattern in both high-risk papillomas and SCC. Additional classifier algorithms generated a gene list that correctly classified unknown benign tumors as low- or high-risk concordant with promotion protocol and keratin profiling.

Chemical induction of squamous tumors in the mouse skin induces multiple benign papillomas: high-frequency terminally benign low-risk papillomas and low-frequency high-risk papillomas, the putative precursor lesions to squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). We have compared the gene expression profile of twenty different early low- and high-risk papillomas with normal skin and SCC. Unsupervised clustering of 514 differentially expressed genes (P<0.001) showed that 9/10 high-risk papillomas clustered with SCC, while 1/10 clustered with low-risk papillomas, and this correlated with keratin markers of tumor progression. Prediction analysis for microarrays (PAM) identified 87 genes that distinguished the two papilloma classes, and a majority of these had a similar expression pattern in both high-risk papillomas and SCC. Additional classifier algorithms generated a gene list that correctly classified unknown benign tumors as low- or high-risk concordant with promotion protocol and keratin profiling. Reduced expression of immune function genes characterized the high-risk papillomas and SCC. Immunohistochemistry confirmed reduced T-cell number in high-risk papillomas, suggesting that reduced adaptive immunity defines papillomas that progress to SCC.

Toxic compounds such as carcinogens are removed from the body by the action of a series of detoxifying enzymes and transporters expressed in the liver and the small intestine. We have found that intestinal epithelial cells expressing the SV40 large T antigen (TAg) contain significantly lower levels of mRNAs, encoding several drug metabolizing/detoxifying enzymes and transporters compared to their non-transgenic littermates. In addition, TAg blocks the induction of these mRNAs by xenobiotics. The repression depends on an intact LXCXE motif in TAg, suggesting that inactivation of the retinoblastoma (Rb) family of tumor suppressors plays a role in the process. These results imply that a functional Rb pathway in the intestine is necessary for the expression of the detoxification system used to clear carcinogens, and suggest that loss of this tumor suppressor might alter susceptibility to chemical injury. In addition, the effect of TAg on the detoxification pathway appears to be tissue-specific, as its ectopic expression in the liver failed to suppress the P450 enzymes. The TAg-mediated suppression of drug metabolizing/detoxifying enzymes may have broad implications in the metabolism and mechanism of action of both carcinogens and prescription drugs.					1555	9446	2952	7421	57007	1558	66002	373156	1244	6578	1557	1576	1580

The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a serine/threonine kinase that controls many aspects of cellular physiology, including transcription, translation, cell size, cytoskeletal organization and autophagy. Recent advances in the mTOR signaling field have found that mTOR exists in two heteromeric complexes, mTORC1 and mTORC2. The activity of mTORC1 is regulated by the integration of many signals, including growth factors, insulin, nutrients, energy availability and cellular stressors such as hypoxia, osmotic stress, reactive oxygen species and viral infection. In this review we highlight recent advances in the mTOR signaling field that relate to how the two mTOR complexes are regulated, and we discuss stress conditions linked to the mTOR signaling network that have not been extensively covered in other reviews. Given the diversity of signals that have been shown to impinge on mTOR, we also speculate on other signal-transduction pathways that may be linked to mTOR in the future.					6009	6794	5563	57521	29072	54541

Functions encoded by single genes in lower organisms are often represented by multiple related genes in the mammalian genome. An example is the retinoblastoma and E2F families of proteins that regulate transcription during the cell cycle. Analysis of gene function using germline mutations is often confounded by overlapping function resulting in compensation. Indeed, in cells deleted of the E2F1 or E2F3 genes, there is an increase in the expression of the other family member. To avoid complications of compensatory effects, we have used small-interfering RNAs that target individual E2F proteins to generate a temporary loss of E2F function. We find that both E2F1 and E2F3 are required for cells to enter the S phase from a quiescent state, whereas only E2F3 is necessary for the S phase in growing cells. We also find that the acute loss of E2F3 activity affects the expression of genes encoding DNA replication and mitotic activities, whereas loss of E2F1 affects a limited number of genes that are distinct from those regulated by E2F3. We conclude that the long-term loss of E2F activity does lead to compensation by other family members and that the analysis of acute loss of function reveals specific and distinct roles for these proteins.					1073	9818	3014	3836	1869	27063	51203	10216	8091	6364

Aberrant expression of the human homeobox-containing proto-oncogene TLX1/HOX11 inhibits hematopoietic differentiation programs in a number of murine model systems. Here, we report the establishment of a murine erythroid progenitor cell line, iEBHX1S-4, developmentally arrested by regulatable TLX1 expression. Extinction of TLX1 expression released the iEBHX1S-4 differentiation block, allowing erythropoietin-dependent acquisition of erythroid markers and hemoglobin synthesis. Coordinated activation of erythroid transcriptional networks integrated by the acetyltransferase co-activator CREB-binding protein (CBP) was suggested by bioinformatic analysis of the upstream regulatory regions of several conditionally induced iEBHX1S-4 gene sets. In accord with this notion, CBP-associated acetylation of GATA-1, an essential regulator of erythroid differentiation, increased concomitantly with TLX1 downregulation. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments and glutathione-S-transferase pull-down assays revealed that TLX1 directly binds to CBP, and confocal laser microscopy demonstrated that the two proteins partially colocalize at intranuclear sites in iEBHX1S-4 cells. Notably, the distribution of CBP in conditionally blocked iEBHX1S-4 cells partially overlapped with chromatin marked by a repressive histone methylation pattern, and downregulation of TLX1 coincided with exit of CBP from these heterochromatic regions. Thus, we propose that TLX1-mediated differentiation arrest may be achieved in part through a mechanism that involves redirection of CBP and/or its sequestration in repressive chromatin domains.					9987	54851	2146	4605	6777	1059	2237	5078	10401	672	641	9212	5451	6772	4097	7709	7027	1786	10438	4091	5427	1869	648	5987	8531	4801	4174	4802	9063	2355	1058	5424	7014	2000	7153	8928	5089	6670	286	4172	8398	9575	25833	11335	4176	51479	6605	3146	8863	5439	4784	2623	3297	1660	6256	29128	466	406	11232	5861	5933	9247	4149	9156	3148	892	10664	4281	4171	8930	3397	5422	1060	4173	5862	7879	24137

The ATM protein kinase, functionally missing in patients with the human genetic disorder ataxia-telangiectasia, is a master regulator of the cellular network induced by DNA double-strand breaks. The ATM gene is also frequently mutated in sporadic cancers of lymphoid origin. Here, we applied a functional genomics approach that combined gene expression profiling and computational promoter analysis to obtain global dissection of the transcriptional response to ionizing radiation in murine lymphoid tissue. Cluster analysis revealed a prominent pattern characterizing dozens of genes whose response to irradiation was Atm-dependent. Computational analysis identified significant enrichment of the binding site signatures of NF-kappaB and p53 among promoters of these genes, pointing to the major role of these two transcription factors in mediating the Atm-dependent transcriptional response in the irradiated lymphoid tissue. Examination of the response showed that pro- and antiapoptotic signals were simultaneously induced, with the proapoptotic pathway mediated by p53 targets, and the prosurvival pathway by NF-kappaB targets. These findings further elucidate the molecular network induced by IR, point to novel putative NF-kappaB targets, and suggest a mechanistic model for cellular balancing between pro- and antiapoptotic signals induced by IR in lymphoid tissues, which has implications for cancer management. The emerging model suggests that restoring the p53-mediated apoptotic arm while blocking the NF-kappaB-mediated prosurvival arm could effectively increase the radiosensitivity of lymphoid tumors.					7538	4738	154	55192	1306	51503	286826	1687	5362	50486	8433	151295	1647	8870	467	1678	11060	5269	55603	1019	1843	92906	7422	317772	6513	3725	3290	7884	6446	10484	7535	54663	8907	5049	6271	9592	54361	2353	6388	3507	7203	1958	5968	55088	94234

Menin is encoded by the tumor suppressor gene MEN1 that is mutated in patients with an inherited tumor syndrome, multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1). Although menin is a nuclear protein and directly binds to DNA through its nuclear localization signals (NLSs), the precise role for each of the NLSs in nuclear translocation and gene expression remains to be elucidated. Here, we show that point mutations in three individual NLSs, NLS1, NLS2, and a novel accessory NLS, NLSa, do not block nuclear translocation, but compromise the ability of menin to repress expression of the endogenous insulin-like growth factor binding protein-2 (IGFBP-2) gene. This repression is not released by an inhibitor of histone deacetylases. Although subtle mutations in menin NLSs do not affect menin association with chromatin, they abolish menin binding to the IGFBP-2 promoter in vivo. Furthermore, each of the NLSs is also crucial for menin-mediated induction of caspase 8 expression. Together, these results suggest that menin may act as a scaffold protein in coordinating activation and repression of gene transcription and that its NLSs play a more important role in controlling gene transcription than merely targeting menin into the nucleus.					3678	10580	3488	255877	2258	29887	8125	391059	4921	3218	7102	2152	6004	1381	112464	64343	51170	841	27164	1264	8728	9317	55859	26471

Activated forms of Ras family members are prevalent in many cancers where Ras mutants transduce signals essential for transformation, angiogenesis, invasion and metastasis. As a cancer progression model, we used NIH3T3 cells to explore the mechanism of Ras-induced tumorigenesis. Ras family mutants H-RasV12 and Rit79L strongly induced foci formation, while Rho family mutants RhoA-QL, Rac1-QL and Cdc42-QL were less effective. A comparison of downstream transcriptional targets of Ras and Rho family members using a 26 383 element cDNA microarray revealed that the osteopontin (OPN) gene exhibited the best correlation between magnitude of gene expression change and level of foci formation (r=0.96, P<0.001). In association with H-RasV12- and Rit79L-mediated transformation, foci secreted OPN protein and upregulated the OPN receptor CD44, suggesting the novel initiation of an aberrant OPN-CD44-Rac autocrine pathway. In support of this were the following observations. First, RGD-deficient OPN protein-binding activity was present in H-RasV12-transformed cells but not in control cells, and binding activity was inhibited by the CD44 blocking antibody. Second, foci formation, cell invasion and Rac activity were induced by H-RasV12 and inhibited by the CD44 blocking antibody. Third, foci formation by H-RasV12 was substantially reduced by a short interfering RNA (siRNA) specifically targeting OPN expression for knockdown. Fourth, H-RasV12-mediated transformation was not blocked by the GRGDS peptide, suggesting that OPN effects were not mediated by the integrins. Lastly, OPN knockdown affected the downstream expression of 160 '2nd tier' genes, and at least a subset of these genes appears to be involved in transformation. Indeed, four genes were selected for knockdown, each resulting in a disruption of foci formation and/or invasion.

As a cancer progression model, we used NIH3T3 cells to explore the mechanism of Ras-induced tumorigenesis. Ras family mutants H-RasV12 and Rit79L strongly induced foci formation, while Rho family mutants RhoA-QL, Rac1-QL and Cdc42-QL were less effective. A comparison of downstream transcriptional targets of Ras and Rho family members using a 26 383 element cDNA microarray revealed that the osteopontin (OPN) gene exhibited the best correlation between magnitude of gene expression change and level of foci formation (r=0.96, P<0.001). In association with H-RasV12- and Rit79L-mediated transformation, foci secreted OPN protein and upregulated the OPN receptor CD44, suggesting the novel initiation of an aberrant OPN-CD44-Rac autocrine pathway. In support of this were the following observations. First, RGD-deficient OPN protein-binding activity was present in H-RasV12-transformed cells but not in control cells, and binding activity was inhibited by the CD44 blocking antibody. Second, foci formation, cell invasion and Rac activity were induced by H-RasV12 and inhibited by the CD44 blocking antibody. Third, foci formation by H-RasV12 was substantially reduced by a short interfering RNA (siRNA) specifically targeting OPN expression for knockdown. Fourth, H-RasV12-mediated transformation was not blocked by the GRGDS peptide, suggesting that OPN effects were not mediated by the integrins. Lastly, OPN knockdown affected the downstream expression of 160 '2nd tier' genes, and at least a subset of these genes appears to be involved in transformation. Indeed, four genes were selected for knockdown, each resulting in a disruption of foci formation and/or invasion. These results underscore the role of aberrant autocrine signaling and transcriptional networking during tumorigenesis.					222658	6585	4316	55011	5159	5176	2647	84314	81	32	83643	199699	5536	7264	10396	8404	11173	5720	63916	57447	56944	347	84934	51201	151887	6646	10867

The p53 tumour suppressor functions as a transcriptional activator, and several p53-inducible genes that play a critical proapoptotic role have been described. Moreover, p53 regulates the expression of various proteins participating in autoregulatory feedback loops, including proteins that negatively control p53 stability (Mdm2 and Pirh2) or modulate stress-induced phosphorylation of p53 on Ser-46 (p53DINP1 or Wip1), a key event for p53-induced apoptosis. Here, we describe a new systematic analysis of p53 targets using oligonucleotide chips, and report the identification of dapk1 as a novel p53 target. We demonstrate that dapk1 mRNA levels increase in a p53-dependent manner in various cellular settings. Both human and mouse dapk1 genomic loci contain DNA sequences that bind p53 in vitro and in vivo. Since dapk1 encodes a serine/threonine kinase previously shown to suppress oncogene-induced transformation by activating a p19ARF/p53-dependent apoptotic checkpoint, our results suggest that Dapk1 participates in a new positive feedback loop controlling p53 activation and apoptosis.					125965	5236	2309	6515	3880	23412	89796	894	2821	6223	55544	23420	9380	51776	89780	8659	668	4833	283638	55384	2195	8553	60412	22891	800	112399	64065	6926	94241	220042	1978	790	84722	7979	3482	81579	55295	4026	25994	2053	26355	5754	153768	283659	2649	595	116984	50619	126129	1462	115908	5270	254225	10769	11217	5230	133	2681	27023	1612	57096	54541	9780	83443	8516	63982	975	84504	1026	2584	11156	84898	9538	2073	6281	9965	55658	130814	90410	7480	51512	148713	221184	4489	8653	54708	30001	1510	27019	5366	6890	4609	3939	445	55026	3304	664	84261	4712	6636	3680	138162	55859	5987	1847	6615	5202	115265	2104	7922	5627	117854	2201	7164	55367	146542	5211	353322	116372	2719	55326	55214	3397	226	5820	7422	222487	131076	57167	3371	4502	4534	6513	5440	57561	79727	220382	4012	5784	55313	57415	1021	57722	2892	126868	87	581	7867	64393	3099	10560	997	23612	5178	203	387882	2022	54583	5214	10468	7157	51181	23524	9208	25873	900	10440	83667	64782	5033	26586	23336	7167	641638	3178	114915

Since dapk1 encodes a serine/threonine kinase previously shown to suppress oncogene-induced transformation by activating a p19ARF/p53-dependent apoptotic checkpoint, our results suggest that Dapk1 participates in a new positive feedback loop controlling p53 activation and apoptosis.					7855	79677	80309	11216	81693	8028	7175	56956	9031	7372	55914	259	10150	6433	766	5350	10625	905	64795	85365	10741	54505	9221	5577	348	9261	55681	2113	10116	64116	84993	10927	10586	4026	79066	7276	147906	10181	57181	4802	5049	170463	1436	8440	114609	1634	790	25959	4088	3698	203447	84135	9782	552889	10615	23534	54726	130074	339287	10434	55280	866	9475	23095	8540	4808	54407	10617	10594	9467	5345	4691	22919	26259	57162	6005	2690	5340	9774	25957	81611	84248	7037	6934	2627	5156	5308	11261	6907	5950	2887	10652	7266	4152	7414	7532	1453	10484	2244	53335	5239	22936	2243	647979	253943	2976	23165	3156	55937	10120	10061	1902	54838	1629	6909	1949	116064	2017	9110	7092	1290	8243	9667	7113	5265	760	4298	3927	6045	7707	54331	7570	57215	2773	224	152006	57532	6913	2294	80218	80789	214	55740	140890	4602	2263	339324	150290	2037	10845	377	23	3364	64763	9265	646	284371	10979	55327	7095	23275	169200	221914	9147	10106	8829	120	6198	10396	6474	116988	11163	102	1456	23281	8543	22858	8613	4841	212	5090	4893	3832	7586	55119	8886	26017	91137	2626	3178	7077	55833	5325	6926	57619	2011	10390	164	3162	10194	2982	83989	3069	7025	6643	2042	64771	842	10614	4194	22	3936	57045	10165	51666	51274	827	391002	79627	10658	22938	2058	57050	27161	57403	1277	55917	10607	335	10902	6659	3149	375056	10771	10097	5584	54487	6304	51433	2737	4129	54107	55182	1000	2266	10095	52	9464	1660	26266	2149	91179	23111	5295	56992	55219	3572	10439	10409	84656	6421	1102	55920	2874	56254	8879	10631	246175	4094	57645	10623	64844	51495	55312	55571	6514	2122	7917	23446	85465	23654	7705	79646	337	7763	5728	23136	134429	5649	7514	3619	8321	84733	55379	55161	1278	51105	4131	55363	286410	10427	7171	5905	64207	9055	6767	7126	6642	394	3291	10890	3484	627	51514	54936	81875	84196	10970	6311	66008	2043	8869	144717	55207	23760	10600	23168	83483	10723	490	9967	64710	6671	3371	1075	23243	10025	9669	10869	405	23512	3054	79147	4323	80761	58517	8110	5362	1981	55660	91603	54556	4775	1903	6925	9852	292	3839	65117	23767	6943	7357	10521	51535	27339	26133	128077	93487	8029	9989	8880	9188	92140	699	6738	7402	2768	55749	546	2872	9415	4534	57089	8500	7072	161882	6747	6788	996	10914	5292	84061	1439	80232	867	23543	55729	8452	4205	6426	54462	54855	23592	60436	10114	50808	201232	912	23326	29883	285782	55643	4023	2989	23203	336	6464	23174	9755	4826	114625	221527	24148	54	56893	1318	338	51569	6651	2305	9435	6745	84612	4957	10087	6734	9429	1809	3189	64326	7879	55131	5422	8850	5396	201965	400506	1184	4221	65056	57060	11198	84251	6499	213	5495	5660	23468	10640	222658	1297	152503	331	27086	471	55213	163732	7412	9993	6780	7046	1479	151246	678	23291	27131	2029	284	64397	7702	5793	5130	23190	65983	51742	79180	22944	1946	25999	5316	9543	22870	7474	7353	9444	2962	9867	5576	9695	51100	55069	55758	58488	50809	11231	56255	23452	6521	10362	55832	4664	11064	9360	23102

Epidermal growth factor is an important mitogen for hepatocytes. Its overexpression promotes hepatocellular carcinogenesis. To identify the network of genes regulated through EGF, we investigated the liver transcriptome during various stages of hepatocarcinogenesis in EGF2B transgenic mice. Targeted overexpression of IgEGF induced distinct hepatocellular lesions and eventually solid tumours at the age of 6-8 months, as evidenced by histopathology. We used the murine MG U74Av2 oligonucleotide microarrays to identify transcript signatures in 12 tumours of small (n=5, pooled), medium (n=4) and large sizes (n=3), and compared the findings with three nontumorous transgenic livers and four control livers. Global gene expression analysis at successive stages of carcinogenesis revealed hallmarks linked to tumour size. A comparison of gene expression profiles of nontumorous transgenic liver versus control liver provided insight into the initial events predisposing liver cells to malignant transformation, and we found overexpression of c-fos, eps-15, TGIF, IGFBP1, Alcam, ets-2 and repression of Gas-1 as distinct events. Further, when gene expression profiles of small manifested tumours were compared with nontumorous transgenic liver, additional changes were obvious and included overexpression of junB, Id-1, minopontin, villin, claudin-7, RR M2, p34cdc2, cyclinD1 and cyclinB1 among others. These genes are therefore strongly associated with tumour formation. Our study provided new information on the tumour stage-dependent network of EGF-regulated genes, and we identified candidate genes linked to tumorigenes and progression of disease.					7039	5935	7050	7429	6696	55859	1366	6282	8581	780	595	467	10333	1999	302	3875	165	1282	6319	4023	1958	1363	214	6241	2060	5054	9545	5269	760	4050	4288	3856	10950	3726	891	2353	1149	10875	967	4811	3397	2114	389	283120	9056	11344	29760	5359	7033	3484	983	5154	1894	51186	7832	279	5947

Chemical induction of squamous tumors in the mouse skin induces multiple benign papillomas: high-frequency terminally benign low-risk papillomas and low-frequency high-risk papillomas, the putative precursor lesions to squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). We have compared the gene expression profile of twenty different early low- and high-risk papillomas with normal skin and SCC. Unsupervised clustering of 514 differentially expressed genes (P<0.001) showed that 9/10 high-risk papillomas clustered with SCC, while 1/10 clustered with low-risk papillomas, and this correlated with keratin markers of tumor progression. Prediction analysis for microarrays (PAM) identified 87 genes that distinguished the two papilloma classes, and a majority of these had a similar expression pattern in both high-risk papillomas and SCC. Additional classifier algorithms generated a gene list that correctly classified unknown benign tumors as low- or high-risk concordant with promotion protocol and keratin profiling. Reduced expression of immune function genes characterized the high-risk papillomas and SCC. Immunohistochemistry confirmed reduced T-cell number in high-risk papillomas, suggesting that reduced adaptive immunity defines papillomas that progress to SCC. These results demonstrate that murine premalignant lesions can be segregated into subgroups by gene expression patterns that correlate with risk for malignant conversion, and suggest a paradigm for generating diagnostic biomarkers for human premalignant lesions with unknown individual risk for malignant conversion.					3383	10336	55830	7186	7428	27436

Most human lymphomas originate from transformed germinal center (GC) B lymphocytes. While activating mutations and translocations of MYC, BCL2 and BCL6 promote specific GC lymphoma subtypes, other genetic and epigenetic modifications that contribute to malignant progression in the GC remain poorly defined. Recently, aberrant expression of the TCL1 proto-oncogene was identified in major GC lymphoma subtypes. TCL1 transgenic mice offer unique models of both aggressive GC and marginal zone B-cell lymphomas, further supporting a role for TCL1 in B-cell transformation. Here, restriction landmark genomic scanning was employed to discover tumor-associated epigenetic alterations in malignant GC and marginal zone B-cells in TCL1 transgenic mice. Multiple genes were identified that underwent DNA hypermethylation and decreased expression in TCL1 transgenic tumors. Further, we identified a secreted isoform of EPHA7, a member of the Eph family of receptor tyrosine kinases that are able to influence tumor invasiveness, metastasis and neovascularization. EPHA7 was hypermethylated and repressed in both mouse and human GC B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas, with the potential to influence tumor progression and spread. These data provide the first set of hypermethylated genes with the potential to complement TCL1-mediated GC B-cell transformation and spread.					2619	51334	2045	285671	27319	3239	3400	2099	114880	79632	55137	140862	6656	389432	9729	26053	84935	79191	1029	2296	51571	1959	4684	55966	344191	27022	27347	7127	7547	161357	23274	9950	64759	57575	3150	10253	8502	401145	862	5332	64321	730130	57616	4985	3199	134829	57419	6658	140767	5789	25921	2290	114818	9096	93664	23266	140733	26084	161291

Retroviral tagging previously identified putative cancer-causing genes in a mouse brain tumor model where a recombinant Moloney murine leukemia virus encoding the platelet-derived growth factor B-chain (MMLV/PDGFB) was intracerebrally injected in newborn mice. In the present study, expression analysis using cDNA arrays revealed several similarities of virus-induced mouse gliomas with human brain tumors. Brain tumors with short latency contained on average 8.0 retroviral insertions and resembled human glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) whereas long-latency gliomas were of lower grade, similar to human oligodendroglioma (OD) and had 2.3 insertions per tumor. Several known and novel genes of tumor progression or cell markers were differentially expressed between OD- and GBM-like tumors. Array and quantitative real-time PCR analysis demonstrated elevated expression similar to Pdgfralpha of retrovirally tagged genes Abhd2, Ddr1, Fos, Ng2, Ppfibp1, Rad51b and Sulf2 in both glioma types compared to neonatal and adult normal brain. The retrovirally tagged genes Plekhb1, Prex1, Prkg2, Sox10 and 1200004M23Rik were upregulated in the tumors but had a different expression profile than Pdgfralpha whereas Rap1gap, Gli1, Neurl and Camk2b were downregulated in the tumors.

Telomere shortening limits the regenerative capacity of cells during aging and chronic disease but at the same time inhibits tumor progression, and it has yet to be determined which of these mechanisms is dominantly affecting organismal survival. Here we show that telomere shortening in telomerase knockout (mTERC-/-) mice in combination with chronic liver damage significantly reduced organismal survival even though telomere shortening strongly inhibited liver tumor formation. Decreased survival induced by telomere shortening correlated with an imbalance between liver cell proliferation and liver cell apoptosis. Specific changes in gene expression were associated with telomere shortening and chronic liver damage and these gene expression changes were partially reversed by adenovirus mediated telomerase gene delivery.

SASAI_RESISTANCE_TO_NEOPLASTIC_TRANSFROMATION	M1259		16832346	Sasai K,Kakumoto K,Hanafusa H,Akagi T		Table 1			MOUSE_GENE_SYMBOL	Arthur Liberzon	Broad Institute	Genes down-regulated in MEF and REF cells (mouse and rat fibroblasts) but not in TIG3/T cells (human lung fibroblasts expressing TERT [GeneID=7015]) by co-expression of the SV40 early region and the activated HRAS (H-RasV12) [GeneID=3265].	Normal human diploid fibroblasts (HDFs) are refractory to oncogene-mediated transformations in vitro, compared with rodent fibroblasts. As successful oncogene-mediated transformations of normal HDFs have been reported using the human telomerase catalytic subunit, it has been considered that telomerase activity contributes to the species-specific transformability. However, these transformed HDFs are much less malignant compared with those of rodent cells, suggesting the existence of undefined mechanisms that render HDFs resistant to malignant transformation. Here, cDNA microarray analysis identified caveolin-1 as one of the possible cellular factors involved in such mechanisms. The mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) pathway downregulates Caveolin-1 in rodent fibroblasts, transformed by coexpression of the SV40 early region and activated H-Ras. In contrast, the coexpression of these two oncogenes in HDFs failed to reduce the expression level of Caveolin-1. These results strongly suggest the presence of critical differences in events following the phosphorylation of ERK during the activation process of the MAPK signaling pathway between human and rodent cells, as the ERK protein was similarly phosphorylated in both systems. Furthermore, the small interfering RNA-mediated suppression of Caveolin-1 facilitated the oncogene-mediated transformation of normal HDFs, clearly indicating that the differences in the transformability between human and rodent cells are due, at least in part, to the mechanism responsible for the resistance to Ras-induced Caveolin-1 downregulation in HDFs.					2707	5352	780	51421	3659	1031	3572	633	3459	9194	4982	1290	4053	2199	9173	351	3726	1052	4320	6876	6383	7132	1277	10058	5159	50509	6414	3913	5768	857	9510	6387	7043	8839	10516	6001	5118	784	481	3399	64175	1490	8869	1465	3400	11167	1906	7436	7041	2200

Bexarotene (Targretin), is a synthetic high-affinity RXR receptor agonist with limited affinity for RAR receptors. Bexarotene has shown efficacy in a phase I/II trial of non-small-cell lung cancers. However, the chemopreventive efficacy of bexarotene has not been determined in mouse lung cancer models. In this study, we have investigated the ability of bexarotene to inhibit lung tumor progression in the mutant A/J mouse models with genetic alterations in p53 or K-ras, two of the most commonly altered genes in human lung tumorigenesis. Mice were administered vinyl carbamate (VC), a carcinogen, by a single intraperitoneal injection (i.p.) at 6 weeks of age. Bexarotene was given by gavage starting at 16 weeks after VC and was continued for 12 weeks. Although all mice developed lung tumors, only 7% of lung tumors were adenocarcinomas in wild-type mice, whereas 22 and 26% of lung tumors were adenocarcinomas in p53 transgenic or K-ras heterozygous deficient mice. Bexarotene inhibited both tumor multiplicity and tumor volume in mice of all three genotypes. Furthermore, bexarotene reduced the progression of adenoma to adenocarcinoma by approximately 50% in both p53(wt/wt)K-ras(ko/wt) and p53(wt/wt)K-ras(wt/wt) mice. Thus, bexarotene appears to be an effective preventive agent against lung tumor growth and progression.					377677	56998	9075	4350	57019	57057	51450	3195	672	4799	26505	1945	140290	664	29098	5922	763	1001	11010	3912	1950	8786	131474	154150	634	84269	133418	10013	54584	79370	1990	136227	2245	3068

SHANK_TAL1_TARGETS_DN	M1266		16407836	Shank-Calvo JA,Draheim K,Bhasin M,Kelliher MA		Table 2: Fold change < 0			SEQ_ACCESSION	Leona Saunders	Broad Institute	Genes down-regulated in preleukemic thymocytes from transgenic mice which overexpress TAL1 [GeneID=6886] in thymus.	Analysis of the INK4A/ARF locus in human T-ALL patients revealed frequent deletions in exon 2, the exon common to both p16(INK4A) and p14(ARF). Other studies have described selective deletion of exon 1beta of p14(ARF) or methylation of the p16(INK4A) promoter. Therefore, it is unclear from these studies whether loss of p16(INK4A) and/or p14(ARF) contributes to the development of T-ALL. To elucidate the relative contribution of the ink4a/arf locus to T-cell leukemogenesis, we mated our tal1 transgenic mice to ink4a/arf-/-, p16(ink4a)-/-, and p19(arf)-/- mice and generated tal1/ink4a/arf+/-, tal1/p16(ink4a)+/-, and tal1/p19(arf)+/- mice. Each of these mice developed T-cell leukemia rapidly, indicating that loss of either p16(ink4a) or p19(arf) cooperates with Tal1 to induce leukemia in mice. Preleukemic studies reveal that Tal1 expression stimulates entry into the cell cycle and thymocyte apoptosis in vivo. Interestingly, mice expressing a DNA-binding mutant of Tal1 do not exhibit increases in S phase cells. The S phase induction is accompanied by an increase in thymocyte apoptosis in tal1 transgenic mice. Whereas apoptosis is reduced to wild-type levels in tal1/ink4a/arf-/- mice, S phase induction remains unaffected. Thus, Tal1 stimulates cell cycle entry independent of the ink4a/arf locus, but its ability to induce apoptosis is Ink4a/Arf-dependent.					920	598	3398	596	923	921	6097	5897	171558	5896

Expression microarray analysis identified CITED1 among a group of genes specifically upregulated in the pubertal mouse mammary gland. At puberty, CITED1 localizes to the luminal epithelial cell population of the mammary ducts and the body cells of the terminal end buds. Generation of CITED1 gene knockout mice showed that homozygous null mutants exhibit retarded mammary ductal growth at puberty and, in addition, dilated ductal structures with a lack of spatial restriction of the subtending branches. Analysis of CITED1 homozygous null and heterozygous null mammary gland gene expression using microarrays suggested that the mammary-specific phenotype seen in the homozygous null females is due to a disturbance in the transcription of a number of key mediators of pubertal ductal morphogenesis. These include estrogen and TGFbeta responsive genes, such as the EGFR/ErbB2 ligand, amphiregulin, whose transcription we suggest is directly or indirectly regulated by CITED1.					5297	4783	1312	8685	6280	6424	6611	4969	7850	4435	3858	9958	5156	80774	51806	285440	5728	5105	4046	3422	7291	4888	2059	316	647264	3290	104	3075	7779	84824	5179	157695	8434	54518	2277	80781	3169	3034	2123	6700	11244	5764	951	8842	2060	1628	3625	4883	5068	347	9314	1508	23452	4610	6354	1958	4481	7058	29802	2940	8522	56265	2213	51450	6533	374	7124	6387	79071

The molecular pathogenesis and the genetic aberrations that lead to the progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate that the thioredoxin interacting protein (Txnip) gene is a candidate tumor suppressor gene in vivo. We previously showed that the recombinant inbred congenic strain HcB-19 has a spontaneous mutation of the Txnip gene, and we now show that the strain has dramatically increased incidence of HCC, and that the HCC cosegregates with the Txnip mutation. Approximately 40% of the Txnip-deficient mice developed hepatic tumors with an increased prevalence in male mice. Visible tumors develop as early as 8 months of age. Histological analysis confirmed the morphology of HCC in the Txnip-deficient mice. Molecular markers of HCC, alpha-fetoprotein and p53, were increased in tumors of Txnip-deficient mice. The upregulation of p53 preceded tumor development; however, bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) labeling of normal hepatic tissue of Txnip-deficient mice did not reveal increased cell proliferation. Finally, microarray analyses of tumor, non-tumor adjacent, and normal tissue of Txnip-deficient mice highlighted the genetic differences leading to the predisposition and onset of HCC. Our findings suggest that Txnip deficiency is sufficient to initiate HCC and suggest novel mechanisms in hepatocarcinogenesis.					7905	391059	6136	91663	6659	8655	4673	23588	153562	2218	51192	10201	22895	84501	1633	128414	4016	28951	214	5279	27076	4023	113130	768211	7153	10529	5916	1503	6398	947	307	1316	23568	4144	57761	3073	51293	7408	8915	4751	79734	27338	7852	55652	9026	10748	1187	4240	64285	3459	128239	23603	6037	90293	3236	10468	4900	51390	11099	1287	6515	4520	204851	79669	55165	126206	84108	23597	222698	5931	7037	4015	55559	5723	286676	2071	119559	10008	359845	390	406	6457	147700	64097	5168	468	56521	1285	6241	4000	834	340348	80114	7163	161253	4739	2017	9076	535	6752	2879	79934	51099	7127	5328	23746	55129	3875	10321	51278	6238	26227	1119	29948	2990	153339	5817	5578	9476	7052	114990	57007	60370	977	11098	10082	100133941	26270	6102	9479	636	11344	23034	140885	10537	50848	23313	79017	2358	56474	121599	440026	9260	51248	5050	56905	3984	1871	6925	53407	382	4308	7278	6324	5791	84269	2798	27433	1594	7042	53630	93185	27301	54682	6622	6456	517	949	642273	57504	3280	83442	7172	10417	64240	3710	23484	55861	2792	200185	10509	79575	9641	6716	81618	8612	1672	5700	10376	54541	666	1476	51365	431707	220382	54997	991	928	7809	4507	121053	7225	10188	5831	7032	192683	3267	26064	23314	3925	25926	3182	9600	100506742	57619	81890	401548	10383	85479	9687	23569	954	123099	10226	8862	10447	57412	29952	54946

Growth factor signaling leads to the induction or repression of immediate early genes, but how these genes act collectively as effectors of downstream processes remains unresolved. We have used gene trap-coupled microarray analysis to identify and mutate multiple platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) intermediate early genes in mice. Mutations in these genes lead to a high frequency of phenotypes that affect the same cell types and processes as those controlled by the PDGF pathway.

The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) p38alpha controls inflammatory responses and cell proliferation. Using mice carrying conditional Mapk14 (also known as p38alpha) alleles, we investigated its function in postnatal development and tumorigenesis. When we specifically deleted Mapk14 in the mouse embryo, fetuses developed to term but died shortly after birth, probably owing to lung dysfunction. Fetal hematopoietic cells and embryonic fibroblasts deficient in p38alpha showed increased proliferation resulting from sustained activation of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)-c-Jun pathway. Notably, in chemical-induced liver cancer development, mice with liver-specific deletion of Mapk14 showed enhanced hepatocyte proliferation and tumor development that correlated with upregulation of the JNK-c-Jun pathway. Furthermore, inactivation of JNK or c-Jun suppressed the increased proliferation of Mapk14-deficient hepatocytes and tumor cells. These results demonstrate a new mechanism whereby p38alpha negatively regulates cell proliferation by antagonizing the JNK-c-Jun pathway in multiple cell types and in liver cancer development.					56924	3695	3727	1647	2273	5621	10912	127495	9963	1850	3725	6422	51665	728392	9402	26047	5608	114900	2786	9636	93035

We performed a high-throughput retroviral insertional mutagenesis screen in mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV)-induced mammary tumors and identified 33 common insertion sites, of which 17 genes were previously not known to be associated with mammary cancer and 13 had not previously been linked to cancer in general. Although members of the Wnt and fibroblast growth factors (Fgf) families were frequently tagged, our exhaustive screening for MMTV insertion sites uncovered a new repertoire of candidate breast cancer oncogenes. We validated one of these genes, Rspo3, as an oncogene by overexpression in a p53-deficient mammary epithelial cell line. The human orthologs of the candidate oncogenes were frequently deregulated in human breast cancers and associated with several tumor parameters. Computational analysis of all MMTV-tagged genes uncovered specific gene families not previously associated with cancer and showed a significant overrepresentation of protein domains and signaling pathways mainly associated with development and growth factor signaling. Comparison of all tagged genes in MMTV and Moloney murine leukemia virus-induced malignancies showed that both viruses target mostly different genes that act predominantly in distinct pathways.					490	84870	85409	116987	1326	23245	2303	1960	2249	2248	7473	3266	57713	23199	221037	2255	5159	6239	2253	2263	4855	5627	10178	28999	7471	5740	340419	3481	3912	57628	2251

In Trim24-null mice, hepatocytes fail to execute proper cell cycle withdrawal during the neonatal-to-adult transition and continue to cycle in adult livers, becoming prone to a continuum of cellular alterations that progress toward metastatic HCC. Using pharmacological approaches, we show that inhibition of retinoic acid signaling markedly reduces hepatocyte proliferation in Trim24-/- mice. We further show that deletion of a single retinoic acid receptor alpha (Rara) allele in a Trim24-null background suppresses HCC development and restores wild-type expression of retinoic acid-responsive genes in the liver, thus demonstrating that in this genetic background Rara expresses an oncogenic activity correlating with a dysregulation of the retinoic acid signaling pathway.

The ternary complex factor Net/Elk3 is downregulated in hypoxia and participates in the induction by hypoxia of several genes, including c-fos, vascular endothelial growth factor and egr-1. However, the global role of Net in hypoxia remains to be elucidated. We have identified, in a large-scale analysis of RNA expression using microarrays, more than 370 genes that are regulated by Net in hypoxia. In order to gain insights into the role of Net in hypoxia, we have analysed in parallel the genes regulated by HIF-1alpha, the classical factor involved in the response to hypoxia. We identified about 190 genes that are regulated by HIF-1alpha in hypoxia. Surprisingly, when we compare the genes induced by hypoxia that require either Net or HIF-1alpha, the majority are the same (75%), suggesting that the functions of both factors are closely linked. Interestingly, in hypoxia, Net regulates the expression of several genes known to control HIF-1alpha stability, including PHD2, PHD3 and Siah2, suggesting that Net regulates the stability of HIF-1alpha. We found that inhibition of Net by RNAi leads to decreased HIF-1alpha expression at the protein level in hypoxia. These results indicate that Net participates in the transcriptional response to hypoxia by regulation of HIF-1alpha protein stability.					178	8553	901	10370	7436	2244	10011	23764

Tumor microenvironment in carcinomas recruits mesenchymal cells with an abnormal proangiogenic and invasive phenotype. It is not clear whether mesenchymal tumor cells (MTCs) derive from the activation of mature fibroblasts or from their stem cell precursors. However, stromal cell activation in tumors resembles in several aspects the mesenchymal rearrangement which normally occurs during reparative processes such as wound healing. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) play a crucial role in developmental and reparative processes and have extraordinary proangiogenic potential, on the basis of which they are thought to show great promise for the treatment of ischemic disorders. Here, we show that MTCs have proangiogenic potential and that they share the transcriptional expression of the best-known proangiogenic factors with MSCs. We also found that MTCs and MSCs have the same molecular signature for stemness-related genes, and that when co-implanted with cancer cells in syngeneic animals MSCs determine early tumor appearance, probably by favoring the angiogenic switch. Our data (1) reveal crucial aspects of the proangiogenic phenotype of MTCs, (2) strongly suggest their stem origin and (3) signal the risk of therapeutic use of MSCs in tumor-promoting conditions.					285	5743	3479	284	7040	1490	5154	3082

Germline mutations in the RET tyrosine kinase gene are responsible for the development of multiple endocrine neoplasia 2A and 2B (MEN2A and MEN2B). However, knowledge of the fundamental principles that determine the mutant RET-mediated signaling remains elusive. Here, we report increased expression of mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase-2 (MKP-2) in carcinomas developed in transgenic mice carrying RET with the MEN2A mutation (RET-MEN2A). The expression of MKP-2 was not only induced by RET-MEN2A or RET-MEN2B mutant proteins but also by the activation of endogenous RET by its ligand, glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF). MKP-2 expression was also evident in the MKK-f cell line, which was established from a mammary tumor developed in a RET-MEN2A transgenic mouse. Inhibition of MKP-2 attenuated the in vitro and in vivo proliferation of MKK-f cells, which was mediated by the suppression of cyclin B1 expression. Furthermore, we found that MKP-2 is highly expressed in medullary thyroid carcinomas derived from MEN2A patients. These findings suggest that the increased expression of MKP-2 may play a crucial role in oncogenic signaling downstream of mutant RET, leading to deregulation of cell cycle.					5979	1846	3434	83850	2919	340146	1301	79132	11274	3665	347735

The von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor pVHL regulates the stability of hypoxia-inducible factors (HIF)-1 and -2, oxygen-sensitive basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors, which mediate the hypoxic induction of angiogenic growth factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor. Loss of pVHL function results in constitutive activation of HIF-1 and HIF-2 and is associated with the development of highly vascularized tumors in multiple organs. We have used a conditional gene-targeting approach to investigate the relative contributions of HIF-1 and HIF-2 to VHL-associated vascular tumorigenesis in a mouse model of liver hemangiomas. Here we demonstrate genetically that conditional inactivation of HIF-2alpha suppressed the development of VHL-associated liver hemangiomas and that angiogenic gene expression in hepatocytes is predominantly regulated by HIF-2 and not by HIF-1. These findings suggest that HIF-2 is the dominant HIF in the pathogenesis of VHL-associated vascular tumors and that pharmacologic targeting of HIF-2 may be an effective strategy for their treatment.					283	652	1717	5340	1432

The Runx genes are important in development and cancer, where they can act either as oncogenes or tumour suppressors. We compared the effects of ectopic Runx expression in established fibroblasts, where all three genes produce an indistinguishable phenotype entailing epithelioid morphology and increased cell survival under stress conditions. Gene array analysis revealed a strongly overlapping transcriptional signature, with no examples of opposing regulation of the same target gene. A common set of 50 highly regulated genes was identified after further filtering on regulation by inducible RUNX1-ER. This set revealed a strong bias toward genes with annotated roles in cancer and development, and a preponderance of targets encoding extracellular or surface proteins, reflecting the marked effects of Runx on cell adhesion. Furthermore, in silico prediction of resistance to glucocorticoid growth inhibition was confirmed in fibroblasts and lymphoid cells expressing ectopic Runx. The effects of fibroblast expression of common RUNX1 fusion oncoproteins (RUNX1-ETO, TEL-RUNX1 and CBFB-MYH11) were also tested. Although two direct Runx activation target genes were repressed (Ncam1 and Rgc32), the fusion proteins appeared to disrupt the regulation of downregulated targets (Cebpd, Id2 and Rgs2) rather than impose constitutive repression. These results elucidate the oncogenic potential of the Runx family and reveal novel targets for therapeutic inhibition.					3693	7079	5648	6354	56256	11117	5129	11060	203197	4684	127544	30061	7357	8869	157506	4061	1545	387695	6347	51129	28984

The parkin was first identified as a gene implicated in autosomal recessive juvenile Parkinsonism. Deregulation of the parkin gene, however, has been observed in various human cancers, suggesting that the parkin gene may be important in tumorigenesis. To gain insight into the physiologic role of parkin, we generated parkin-/- mice lacking exon 3 of the parkin gene. We demonstrated here that parkin-/- mice had enhanced hepatocyte proliferation and developed macroscopic hepatic tumors with the characteristics of hepatocellular carcinoma. Microarray analyses revealed that parkin deficiency caused the alteration of gene expression profiles in the liver. Among them, endogenous follistatin is commonly upregulated in both nontumorous and tumorous liver tissues of parkin-deficient mice. Parkin deficiency resulted in suppression of caspase activation and rendered hepatocytes resistant to apoptosis in a follistatin-dependent manner. These results suggested that parkin deficiency caused enhanced hepatocyte proliferation and resistance to apoptosis, resulting in hepatic tumor development, partially through the upregulation of endogenous follistatin. The finding that parkin-deficient mice are susceptible to hepatocarcinogenesis provided the first evidence showing that parkin is indeed a tumor suppressor gene.					3303	10468	6783	84696	337	64216	2919	9027	440	325

Cancer cells differentiate along specific lineages that largely determine their clinical and biologic behavior. Distinct cancer phenotypes from different cells and organs likely result from unique gene expression repertoires established in the embryo and maintained after malignant transformation. We used comprehensive gene expression analysis to examine this concept in the prostate, an organ with a tractable developmental program and a high propensity for cancer. We focused on gene expression in the murine prostate rudiment at three time points during the first 48 h of exposure to androgen, which initiates proliferation and invasion of prostate epithelial buds into surrounding urogenital sinus mesenchyme. Here, we show that androgen exposure regulates genes previously implicated in prostate carcinogenesis comprising pathways for the phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), fibroblast growth factor (FGF)/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and Wnt signaling along with cellular programs regulating such 'hallmarks' of cancer as angiogenesis, apoptosis, migration and proliferation. We found statistically significant evidence for novel androgen-induced gene regulation events that establish and/or maintain prostate cell fate. These include modulation of gene expression through microRNAs, expression of specific transcription factors, and regulation of their predicted targets. By querying public gene expression databases from other tissues, we found that rather than generally characterizing androgen exposure or epithelial budding, the early prostate development program more closely resembles the program for human prostate cancer. Most importantly, early androgen-regulated genes and functional themes associated with prostate development were highly enriched in contrasts between increasingly lethal forms of prostate cancer, confirming a 'reactivation' of embryonic pathways for proliferation and invasion in prostate cancer progression. Among the genes with the most significant links to the development and cancer, we highlight coordinate induction of the transcription factor Sox9 and suppression of the proapoptotic phospholipid-binding protein Annexin A1 that link early prostate development to early prostate carcinogenesis. These results credential early prostate development as a reliable and valid model system for the investigation of genes and pathways that drive prostate cancer.					1359	8436	25797	7432	64231	5654	57381	2167	51678	3067	11260	132204	57489	10234	6507	5052	3431	84624	57213	1956	8974	5706	8404	5198	5728	857	59353	4828	9987	90693	1519	5579	8817	221091	139818	143282	126208	8503	11235	1080	3475	64750	80298	6863	831	6880	81855	10600	54826	6198	9166	2729	6745	3251	223	55848	7739	9412	51193	7088	53844	27244	51312	10159	55340	83640	23683	26994	2191	26033	23594	84888	4664	5610	92181	100506742	4691	567	26468	7336	56920	9706	200894	7305	10955	23248	54708	4043	81035	23643	51000	8910	54209	796	283635	8894	11318	29071	2632	54962	5264	340351	161198	276	5742	10605	4256	84889	6386	1855	92906	4969	85458	1475	375444	9123	4152	9419	178	10563	5787	58475	3376	837	123803	91612	339745	10492	9509	7412	90416	23032	8639	11251	715	2673	54829	98	51251	4900	9887	60626	55635	284129	55754	687	6009	116328	29978	9616	54602	2277	57147	51660	3895	4641	84233	38	22915	9063	55819	55032	4883	79949	388886	153129	6691	8706	51119	28982	3482	8604	57150	10924	10175	24149

These results credential early prostate development as a reliable and valid model system for the investigation of genes and pathways that drive prostate cancer.					26168	23022	84445	284352	1808	5261	30827	54510	25932	5886	22850	4343	5905	1105	5660	342527	5139	8841	10656	10365	10755	7077	3655	29994	10675	23186	6500	25764	57597	124402	5690	51319	23580	8704	2288	57862	27107	54790	4245	23753	51015	8106	1975	1487	6764	129080	200576	7184	55571	79735	23091	7475	9181	216	26053	29946	23484	9249	7329	51107	9874	6711	285382	51692	4188	2893	51478	79633	27299	1366	4800	56339	22894	14	5034	118987	57171	91522	112770	51147	5315	7913	9146	6659	3775	49855	27161	4200	4026	6697	10992	5718	55219	1112	23236	27333	51222	51596	84295	607	5499	151011	56994	9698	5738	1209	4610	23065	9073	728489	7541	5218	10330	8535	1019	25948	148479	5326	4253	23215	121665	51542	79139	89887	840	5245	26523	51164	9703	4929	51232	10421	3845	6141	4035	55766	2820	8729	1072	23530	821	4076	11335	351	55742	55159	57532	593	54856	4335	51124	3183	23607	221443	3326	3312	9993	4678	694	55450	388	54812	396	4062	23008	10959	57118	51322	112849	201965	2995	51028	64400	6624	23613	29116	146395	5818	5589	10189	3688	51474	5019	57698	4259	2935	1656	23670	10801	10226	3239	521	64864	8204	9221	1786	54413	51780	23304	51535	83874	23135	2967	11319	5045	170506	389432	3880	80320	8568	283638	989	3146	51645	8284	57222	3899	51282	9315	10513	284069	80146	23164	6853	7531	83596	56005	51726	51274	9774	9414	27436	80205	7170	57568	8661	800	4851	29128	8574	4697	117581	9592	54972	23543	27303	79098	9411	26155	84300	8416	4072	90102	10245	80144	8819	134553	7873	847	3156	10912	5708	5704	84191	11078	57586	81928	11014	10766	58516	652	4784	2624	144717	3983	81857	22949	7074	4267	481	55755	84271	55112	6223	6634	56977	7027	5529	55643	200081	23309	4300	54985	3480	89796	3720	1017	7534	345557	54439	8467	10782	3399	57181	349633	8189	23286	3609	6421	7570	9839	125058	5202	54870	3209	2969	121504	58489	2817	55035	201475	92815	124565	221955	11244	7379	5830	1572	9500	9092	8338	92799	619279	1387	9898	55660	10728	5754	8502	10983	3624	9079	1108	64083	58499	22938	5781	11165	57551	1213	6662	54542	143686	54434	54505	3009	5216	1525	221908	1265	4046	3006	79845	84298	6868	2803	29966	84146	2771	4430	64844	7380	221154	26528	3856	7357	7157	1465	26011	60481	79658	10093	390	9967	2936	6767	2318	56650	1107	140609	9792	5789	6872	8669	9759	6546	6929	9648	93129	399948	6418	1973	1994	54778	27327	140735	55671	284058	9516	808	84159	5795	10548	55700	1849	399909	84456	3191	29123	79026	59343	26058	3008	2045	27044	6497	285527	55108	6595	81603	598	1788	64215	283237	23476	1903	10933	3033	114294	9689	132430	5763	7227	5531	23054	54458	55664	8335	9611	6091	10163	2028	605	6636	5757	8887	3693	10514	6241	4774	2896	53635	811	65125	6698	23499	389792	6664	6625	2192	65108	7026	377	3796	22873	10362	26127	23112	51176	5978	3206	3020	8370	27000	8359	57216	463	56061	8683	51094	5396	2113	122830	8360	5803	10494	1452	9218	3397	23293	3192	2625	4734	359948	93649	8361	1650	3398	64710	51604	64094	10949	9601	58508

Cancer cells differentiate along specific lineages that largely determine their clinical and biologic behavior. Distinct cancer phenotypes from different cells and organs likely result from unique gene expression repertoires established in the embryo and maintained after malignant transformation. We used comprehensive gene expression analysis to examine this concept in the prostate, an organ with a tractable developmental program and a high propensity for cancer. We focused on gene expression in the murine prostate rudiment at three time points during the first 48 h of exposure to androgen, which initiates proliferation and invasion of prostate epithelial buds into surrounding urogenital sinus mesenchyme. Here, we show that androgen exposure regulates genes previously implicated in prostate carcinogenesis comprising pathways for the phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), fibroblast growth factor (FGF)/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and Wnt signaling along with cellular programs regulating such 'hallmarks' of cancer as angiogenesis, apoptosis, migration and proliferation. We found statistically significant evidence for novel androgen-induced gene regulation events that establish and/or maintain prostate cell fate. These include modulation of gene expression through microRNAs, expression of specific transcription factors, and regulation of their predicted targets. By querying public gene expression databases from other tissues, we found that rather than generally characterizing androgen exposure or epithelial budding, the early prostate development program more closely resembles the program for human prostate cancer. Most importantly, early androgen-regulated genes and functional themes associated with prostate development were highly enriched in contrasts between increasingly lethal forms of prostate cancer, confirming a 'reactivation' of embryonic pathways for proliferation and invasion in prostate cancer progression.

These results credential early prostate development as a reliable and valid model system for the investigation of genes and pathways that drive prostate cancer.					216	3485	6446	4907	2877	7164	796	283078	132204	29995	1545	11197	54361	301	220	8653	80310	4316	8000	5321	7430	2202	10103	2625	51316	728116	171546	634	6296	26084	5997	9324	6776	1191	1288	57402	793	9953	64093	10551	253512	4013	2940	1364	3248	768239	28999	64218	54206	4014	7263	6783	8190	1287	6510	6662	7464	2922	9073	126	3751	8673	4299	51299	56898	84189	92737	2118	5359	8543	10912	30061	10135	4126	27299	203328	8416	2822	5368	55509	25984	130574	2289	53828	6817	79098	4824	29842	27164	84525	389058	90701	2042	6549	7404	9536	56475	192668	2752	55287	1735	54829	140738	56169	644890	10449	65997	64116	3783	1572	8471	11187	6343	255631	8204	9249	79589	128178	10955	3855	84532	5179	9194	646424	3866	90865	54677	6821	3773	115265	2683	9519	376267	55092	3920	6939	10267	7436	9420	3399	22800	349633	1052	221303	3398	100133941	79720	26577	687	7286	3219	11005	1014	54997	79038	23237	11261	7484	5349	51704	4792	25976	147372	5878	239	185	1848	79064	79905	51473	1006	2261	87769	27237	5867	51761	51090	173	151556	59084	128338	3489	22949	137075	598	1775	622	59341	10161	6469	8702	55195	8284	26751	154141	89944	140469	999	10203	9340	353189	5603	3105	10257	133418	9265	57007	84000	1001	5827	57569	23071	9403	1728	116461	3775	476	284161	3169	347404	56034	11345	6482	10178	155368	202	6578	55103	54836	596	202915	54491	51655	84299	1318	64222	84870	55840	80320	23632	8854	196374	6692	87178	10899	1519	2257	64236	79136	2621	6337	147798	9476	9446	7379	3860	2230	168620	9914	117177	105	3206	66004	54981	9289	399948	4351	55022	25854	8440	22837	55503	8554	7113	23612	2263	57228	84418	10447	54898	5783	9935	3911	2934	728215	130340	90273	26090	64399	373156	56674	5333	344875	147381	143098	25798	54949	23359	64968	4061	1012	3993	51181	157506	27345	53820	56256	84879	5764	1800	7852	23052	200010	8766	10370	57146	2053	2729	3397	4329	79705	6038	726	7022	8935	10797	10149	55080	647024	57222	57111	92241	2182	3306	23708	1159	79816	84216	7201	27241	2013	728656	23479	54102	10481	11082	389816	1368	1299	3106	1999	9920	150696	79961	254295	9213	6716	11172	57214	64284	11072	5493	11344	137797	57128	23593	79683	7873	80201	3815	3691	85377	286077	5627	93517	3234	54857	6993	222171	360	284353	5358	5648	9712	10863	162427	51128	6423	7869	10675	56160	57604	9651	59271	6640	84293	79594	84275	79956	84451	84270	26	4155	5154	814	2941	146456	575	374907	100506144	80831	138241	3598	51144	23321	8614	4065	28970	84899	26037	1592	140876	140545	23382	23554	170690	4094	65268	9445	6558	51365	4072	8495	389206	9936	642273	79754	6698	7088	54498	9719	83543	55107	10809	3880	200844	4070	54741	5281	1741	27075	7475	306	57119	51234	283927	4074	1893	5362	6747	55970	23484	4502	801	150084	1906	4188	1831	10961	4645	5101	56892	90355	90634	9734	27063	5805	83716	56951	154091	23127	10690	9099	29978	64129	29104	5931

Cancer cells differentiate along specific lineages that largely determine their clinical and biologic behavior. Distinct cancer phenotypes from different cells and organs likely result from unique gene expression repertoires established in the embryo and maintained after malignant transformation. We used comprehensive gene expression analysis to examine this concept in the prostate, an organ with a tractable developmental program and a high propensity for cancer. We focused on gene expression in the murine prostate rudiment at three time points during the first 48 h of exposure to androgen, which initiates proliferation and invasion of prostate epithelial buds into surrounding urogenital sinus mesenchyme. Here, we show that androgen exposure regulates genes previously implicated in prostate carcinogenesis comprising pathways for the phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), fibroblast growth factor (FGF)/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and Wnt signaling along with cellular programs regulating such 'hallmarks' of cancer as angiogenesis, apoptosis, migration and proliferation. We found statistically significant evidence for novel androgen-induced gene regulation events that establish and/or maintain prostate cell fate. These include modulation of gene expression through microRNAs, expression of specific transcription factors, and regulation of their predicted targets. By querying public gene expression databases from other tissues, we found that rather than generally characterizing androgen exposure or epithelial budding, the early prostate development program more closely resembles the program for human prostate cancer. Most importantly, early androgen-regulated genes and functional themes associated with prostate development were highly enriched in contrasts between increasingly lethal forms of prostate cancer, confirming a 'reactivation' of embryonic pathways for proliferation and invasion in prostate cancer progression.

However, in mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs), c-Myc also induces apoptosis by activating the p19Arf tumor suppressor pathway. Tbx2, a transcriptional repressor of p19Arf, can collaborate with c-Myc by suppressing apoptosis. MEFs overexpressing c-Myc and Tbx2 are immortal but not transformed. We have performed an unbiased genetic screen, which identified 12 oncogenes that collaborate with c-Myc and Tbx2 to transform MEFs in vitro. One of them encodes the LPA2 receptor for the lipid growth factor lysophosphatidic acid (LPA). We find that LPA1 and LPA4, but not LPA3, can reproduce the transforming effect of LPA2. Using pharmacological inhibitors, we show that the in vitro cell transformation induced by LPA receptors is dependent on the Gi-linked ERK and PI3K signaling pathways. The transforming ability of LPA1, LPA2 and LPA4 was confirmed by tumor formation assays in vivo and correlated with prolonged ERK1/2 activation in response to LPA. Our results reveal a direct role for LPA receptor signaling in cell transformation and tumorigenesis in conjunction with c-Myc and reduced p19Arf expression.					10783	9146	2318	5894	2354	23263	375790	4215	9170	81	5155	29841

Polarized hepatocytes expressing hyperactive Ha-Ras adopt an invasive and metastatic phenotype in cooperation with transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta. This dramatic increase in malignancy is displayed by an epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), which mimics the TGF-beta-mediated progression of human hepatocellular carcinomas. In culture, hepatocellular EMT occurs highly synchronously, facilitating the analysis of molecular events underlying the various stages of this process. Here, we show that in response to TGF-beta, phosphorylated Smads rapidly translocated into the nucleus and activated transcription of target genes such as E-cadherin repressors of the Snail superfamily, causing loss of cell adhesion. Within the TGF-beta superfamily of cytokines, TGF-beta1, -beta2 and -beta3 were specific for the induction of hepatocellular EMT. Expression profiling of EMT kinetics revealed 78 up- and 235 downregulated genes, which preferentially modulate metabolic activities, extracellular matrix composition, transcriptional activities and cell survival. Independent of the genetic background, platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-A ligand and both PDGF receptor subunits were highly elevated, together with autocrine secretion of bioactive PDGF. Interference with PDGF signalling by employing hepatocytes expressing the dominant-negative PDGF-alpha receptor revealed decreased TGF-beta-induced migration in vitro and efficient suppression of tumour growth in vivo. In conclusion, these results provide evidence for a crucial role of PDGF in TGF-beta-mediated tumour progression of hepatocytes and suggest PDGF as a target for therapeutic intervention in liver cancer.					6277	4134	1435	4086	1140	7025	1290	5045	6602	5154	908	4288	3688	1281	5930	2734	4684	5317	1490	5048	3490	7078	2335	7150	1277	4065	3921	6347	4942	6354	2624	1284	3725	1000	3624	7076	8463	4953	5627	59	7543	7043	7187	5054	1058	672	4172	3625	1282	10733	5933	1514	2199	3371	3566	1545	5480	80781	3146	8777	7174	1111	1633	1906	5321	4616	1191	6615	345611

In conclusion, these results provide evidence for a crucial role of PDGF in TGF-beta-mediated tumour progression of hepatocytes and suggest PDGF as a target for therapeutic intervention in liver cancer.					6769	7351	7353	6372	5797	1029	310	3866	5264	1432	22803	2273	2060	523	5720	4609	6284	10484	5134	2819	999	6388	140628	685	5705	127534	506	1891	7019	5825	5179	1573	2622	3205	2665	311	837	9554	6698	6414	8495	5700	9592	6279	397	677	10748	1026	2040	805	2937	22913	963	26578	3929	9314	7328	10681	3052	23587	191	830	55308	529	3020	6647	1628	3713	2339	5002	10963	3557	3554	3187	2353	10987	9091	3145	1907	5167	9049	6342	22931	4792	1499	3732	7086	1958	7153	3161	57062	5243	6150	4121	6920	2944	7416	2222	6045	5744	7163	2770	3965	5066	1376	7170	3070	3880	6654	8061	5567	7157	4322	22928	1755	244	5211	7534	5216	5269	161	10797	5432	1551	1796	6376	5813	55858	10559	6385	51082	1080	7490	4601	5036	10140	34	4071	3170	5270	7881	343	5468	378	646	6426	6510	6788	6917	2059	4014	25819	3398	210	33	6520	23265	7139	262	7203	9368	5281	1363	2286	2919	10134	6727	2950	3698	1207	51274	10456	1182	4360	9520	581	6141	123803	7088	5593	8773	3028	1650	516	10951	1396	6093	3691	7706	5362	2697	6557	10175	9957	1604	7533	9982	2767	5500	1386	2139	8091	53827	836	5801	3958

Intestinal polyposis, a precancerous neoplasia, results primarily from an abnormal increase in the number of crypts, which contain intestinal stem cells (ISCs). In mice, widespread deletion of the tumor suppressor Phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) generates hamartomatous intestinal polyps with epithelial and stromal involvement. Using this model, we have established the relationship between stem cells and polyp and tumor formation. PTEN helps govern the proliferation rate and number of ISCs and loss of PTEN results in an excess of ISCs. In PTEN-deficient mice, excess ISCs initiate de novo crypt formation and crypt fission, recapitulating crypt production in fetal and neonatal intestine. The PTEN-Akt pathway probably governs stem cell activation by helping control nuclear localization of the Wnt pathway effector beta-catenin. Akt phosphorylates beta-catenin at Ser552, resulting in a nuclear-localized form in ISCs. Our observations show that intestinal polyposis is initiated by PTEN-deficient ISCs that undergo excessive proliferation driven by Akt activation and nuclear localization of beta-catenin.					10983	5925	2246	4613	208	4094	3688	7157	896	5154	5325	1026	7042	1894	2004	1021

Most human B cell non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (B-NHLs) derive from germinal centers (GCs), the structure in which B cells undergo somatic hypermutation (SHM) and class switch recombination (CSR) before being selected for high-affinity antibody production. The pathogenesis of B-NHL is associated with distinct genetic lesions, including chromosomal translocations and aberrant SHM, which arise from mistakes occurring during CSR and SHM. A direct link between these DNA remodeling events and GC lymphoma development, however, has not been demonstrated. Here we have crossed three mouse models of B cell lymphoma driven by oncogenes (Myc, Bcl6 and Myc/Bcl6; refs. 5,6) with mice lacking activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID), the enzyme required for both CSR and SHM. We show that AID deficiency prevents Bcl6-dependent, GC-derived B-NHL, but has no impact on Myc-driven, pre-GC lymphomas. Accordingly, abrogation of AID is associated with the disappearance of CSR- and SHM-mediated structural alterations. These results show that AID is required for GC-derived lymphomagenesis, supporting the notion that errors in AID-mediated antigen-receptor gene modification processes are principal contributors to the pathogenesis of human B-NHL.					83699	29927	493	3995	4783	92906	8140	6302	56940	54682	168620	124565	27145	129642	894	501	784	960	55033	11230	7015	2681	5445	4363	120071	84168	9672	3693	79139	6400	7494	55268	3664	4072	2171	1522	51629	9855	8840	5074	55647	11163	2557	59269	1212	6184	26115	9663	10221	10421	64858	3572	2526	6507	6238	10330	5831	5129	3783	4642	9789	84513	3703	144406	10205	4677	1852	10410	7289	900	54900	79573	22849	11072	51390	56905	54855	11253	257194	1051	11018	55151	6382	55353	9236	57222	286467	27018	64778	10391	9695	84275	51805	19	27152	9601	27165	3662	94241	10972	100129269	55326	58477	26003	5470	219749	9120	11014	6498	6404	7873	23420	10787	953	23612	55069	84709	6745	51566	116447	79974	5167	6746	2823	160518	10653	55825	55062	4147	55075	5464	157807	64764	8736	1832	148808	92140	3998	9545	23484	3069	56204	54502	113235	2135	9099	340061	84561	27293	5817	114876	286451	84553	83707	79156	6768	29760	444	84418	132884	3382	378938	256691	140606	10497	10683	7184	81502	8460	85415	89886	2990	129303	22936	7466	83481	100	656	7371	9741	10370	51061	163183	9415	10970	283987	51303	5034	6730	140735	144165	527	9823	6747	2923	10802	10579	9871	5998	9542	55573	22881	6836	8660	388	1144	81037	7263	440	8459	8706	4502	84144	55212	608	90411	79174	54922	2070	66005	51321	7832	55074	64093	9244	22836	25996	9578	57579	9886	204851	81579	54749	64651	55741	308	10130	3480	7038	5862	57619	54732	583	5875	5224	51520	93986	10455	23555	7082	9500	80765	4489	10409	10413	143689	50515	10945	253782	5291	115290	28972	6692	22822	80824	57715	65244	25853	55840	51465	8912	23076	56243	51463	22862	8800	27075	30001	7052	26960	639	57600	6591

Aside from Myc-activating translocations characteristic of plasmacytomas (PCT), little is known about genetic factors and signaling pathways responsible for the development of spontaneous B-cell lineage lymphomas of mice. Here, we characterized the transcriptional profiles of PCT, centroblastic diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (CBL), and high-grade splenic marginal zone B-cell lymphoma (MZL++) using high-throughput quantitative reverse transcription-PCR. Expression profiles of CBL and MZL++ were strikingly similar and quite unlike that of PCT. Among the genes expressed at significantly higher levels by PCT were a number involved in NOTCH signaling, a finding supported by gene set enrichment analyses of microarray data. To investigate the importance of this pathway, NOTCH signaling was blocked in PCT cell lines by treatment with a gamma-secretase inhibitor (GSI) or transduction of a dominant-negative mutant of MAML1. These treatments resulted in reduced expression of NOTCH transcriptional targets in association with impaired proliferation and increased apoptosis.

These results integrate NOTCH activation with oncogenic signaling pathways downstream of translocated Myc in the pathogenesis of mouse PCT, two signaling pathways also implicated in development of human multiple myeloma and T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma.					3149	930	6886	22806	53335	973	5079	5966	958	3394	4322	6280	579	7472	6689	3201	3195	643	2623

The Emu-myc transgenic mouse has provided a valuable model for the study of B-cell lymphoma. Making use of gene expression analysis and, in particular, expression signatures of cell signaling pathway activation, we now show that several forms of B lymphoma can be identified in the Emu-myc mice associated with time of tumor onset. Furthermore, one form of Emu-myc tumor with pre-B character is shown to resemble human Burkitt lymphoma, whereas others exhibit more differentiated B-cell characteristics and show similarity with human diffuse large B-cell lymphoma in the pattern of gene expression, as well as oncogenic pathway activation. Importantly, we show that signatures of oncogenic pathway activity provide further dissection of the spectrum of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, identifying a subset of patients who have very poor prognosis and could benefit from more aggressive or novel therapeutic strategies. Taken together, these studies provide insight into the complexity of the oncogenic process and a novel strategy for dissecting the heterogeneity of B lymphoma.					7846	29127	29968	9133	2028	133418	5901	3014	8835	4175	203068	23397	81611	6240	1163	3149	4176	5928	2207	3182	983	10383	23640	3925	6352	2597	81	3416	1026	219972	2953	3001	3161	1791	26227	9833	6599	2886	4282	3978	94239	5888	51514	4288	1396	7153	4258	83879	256949	79733	11065	222487	64710	651746	3151	6713	51176	2012	10051	1622	6241	6790	10267	4171	2022	9055	83461	10549	7272	3838	24137	4001	10156	113130	3543	991	2030	10797	170463	7295

Mutation of the genes encoding the WNT signaling components adenomatous polyposis coli or beta-catenin plays a critical role in the initiation of colorectal cancer. These mutations cause constitutively active beta-catenin/TCF-mediated transcription, driving the transformation of intestinal crypts to colorectal cancer precursor lesions, called dysplastic aberrant crypt foci. CD44 is a prominent WNT signaling target in the intestine and is selectively expressed on the renewing epithelial cells lining the crypts. The expression of CD44 is dramatically increased in aberrant crypt foci in both humans and tumor-susceptible Apc(Min/+) mice, suggesting a role for CD44 in intestinal tumorigenesis. To study this role, we crossed C57BL/6J-Cd44(-/-) mice with C57BL/6J-Apc(Min/+) mice. Compared with C57BL/6J-Cd44(+/+)/Apc(Min/+) mice, C57BL/6J-Cd44(-/-)/Apc(Min/+) mice showed an almost 50% reduction in the number of intestinal adenomas. This reduction was primarily caused by a decrease in the formation of aberrant crypts, implying the involvement of CD44 in tumor initiation. The absence of CD44 in the normal (nonneoplastic) crypts of Cd44(-/-)/Apc(Min/+) mice did not alter the proliferative capacity and size of the intestinal stem cell and transit-amplifying compartments. However, compared with Cd44(+/+)/Apc(Min/+) mice, Cd44(-/-)/Apc(Min/+) showed an increase in the number of apoptotic epithelial cells at the base of the crypt which correlated with an increased expression of the proapoptotic genes Bok and Dr6. Our results show an important role for CD44 in intestinal tumorigenesis and suggest that CD44 does not affect proliferation but is involved in the control of the balance between survival and apoptosis in the intestinal crypt.					84957	8764	183	666	5654	824	27242

Egr2 is a transcription factor required for peripheral nerve myelination in rodents, and mutations in Egr2 are associated with congenital hypomyelinating neuropathy (CHN) in humans. To further study its role in myelination, we generated mice harboring a hypomorphic Egr2 allele (Egr2Lo) that survive for up to 3 weeks postnatally, a period of active myelination in rodents. These Egr2Lo/Lo mice provided the opportunity to study the molecular effects of Egr2 deficiency on Schwann cell biology, an analysis that was not possible previously, because of the perinatal lethality of Egr2-null mice. Egr2Lo/Lo mice phenocopy CHN, as evidenced by the severe hypomyelination and increased numbers of proliferating Schwann cells of the peripheral nerves. Comparison of sciatic nerve gene expression profiles during development and after crush injury with those of Egr2Lo/Lo Schwann cells revealed that they are developmentally arrested, with down-regulation of myelination-related genes and up-regulation of genes associated with immature and promyelinating Schwann cells. One of the abnormally elevated genes in Egr2Lo/Lo Schwann cells, Sox2, encodes a transcription factor that is crucial for maintenance of neural stem cell pluripotency. Wild-type Schwann cells infected with Sox2 adenovirus or lentivirus inhibited expression of myelination-associated genes (e.g., myelin protein zero; Mpz), and failed to myelinate axons in vitro, but had an enhanced proliferative response to beta-neuregulin. The characterization of a mouse model of CHN has provided insight into Schwann cell differentiation and allowed the identification of Sox2 as a negative regulator of myelination.					9370	9435	4015	1212	6623	25976	1718	4642	5833	761	4502	4118	6271	50814	5376	7039	4047	4929	2166	1026	20	55117	6307	847	4155	6576	3157	4597	10875	50808	2224	7368	28984	10500	7122	6252	4359	79071	80303	22998	54918	8777	7704	55287	148534	132864	28232	3156	10397	5243	5730	2013	2222	29956	4259	55754	11342	1595	4430	7402	6510	3992	3775	6817	2770	2495	415116	5910	5110	404544	129080	6285	7086	9479	51031	54206	5295	7069	3603	138151	2252	4023	928	5105	4969	6622	4199	3053	114879	102	2674	23139	340371	57716	2051	4629	1604	6332	2705	8682	2246	7869	22933	3422	4504	6513	3707	2530

We combined large-scale mRNA expression analysis and gene mapping to identify genes and loci that control hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) function. We measured mRNA expression levels in purified HSCs isolated from a panel of densely genotyped recombinant inbred mouse strains. We mapped quantitative trait loci (QTLs) associated with variation in expression of thousands of transcripts. By comparing the physical transcript position with the location of the controlling QTL, we identified polymorphic cis-acting stem cell genes. We also identified multiple trans-acting control loci that modify expression of large numbers of genes. These groups of coregulated transcripts identify pathways that specify variation in stem cells. We illustrate this concept with the identification of candidate genes involved with HSC turnover. We compared expression QTLs in HSCs and brain from the same mice and identified both shared and tissue-specific QTLs. Our data are accessible through WebQTL, a web-based interface that allows custom genetic linkage analysis and identification of coregulated transcripts.					728392	79893	10749	5694	4353	140735
KENNY_CTNNB1_TARGETS_UP	M11067		15642117	Kenny PA,Enver T,Ashworth A		Suppl. file 1: top 100 up-regulated genes, converted to human orthologs			HUMAN_GENE_SYMBOL	Yujin Hoshida	Broad Institute	Genes up-regulated in HC11 cells (mammary epithelium) by expression of constantly active CTNNB1 [GeneID=1499].	BACKGROUND: Deregulation of the Wnt/ beta-catenin signal transduction pathway has been implicated in the pathogenesis of tumours in the mammary gland, colon and other tissues. Mutations in components of this pathway result in beta-catenin stabilization and accumulation, and the aberrant modulation of beta-catenin/TCF target genes. Such alterations in the cellular transcriptional profile are believed to underlie the pathogenesis of these cancers. We have sought to identify novel target genes of this pathway in mouse mammary epithelial cells. METHODS: Gene expression microarray analysis of mouse mammary epithelial cells inducibly expressing a constitutively active mutant of beta-catenin was used to identify target genes of this pathway. RESULTS: The differential expression in response to DeltaNbeta-catenin for five putative target genes, Autotaxin, Extracellular Matrix Protein 1 (Ecm1), CD14, Hypoxia-inducible gene 2 (Hig2) and Receptor Activity Modifying Protein 3 (RAMP3), was independently validated by northern blotting. Each of these genes encodes either a receptor or a secreted protein, modulation of which may underlie the interactions between Wnt/beta-catenin tumour cells and between the tumour and its microenvironment. One of these genes, Hig2, previously shown to be induced by both hypoxia and glucose deprivation in human cervical carcinoma cells, was strongly repressed upon DeltaNbeta-catenin induction. The predicted N-terminus of Hig2 contains a putative signal peptide suggesting it might be secreted. Consistent with this, a Hig2-EGFP fusion protein was able to enter the secretory pathway and was detected in conditioned medium. Mutation of critical residues in the putative signal sequence abolished its secretion. The expression of human HIG2 was examined in a panel of human tumours and was found to be significantly downregulated in kidney tumours compared to normal adjacent tissue. CONCLUSIONS: HIG2 represents a novel non-cell autonomous target of the Wnt pathway which is potentially involved in human cancer.					4313	7083	64062	22928	8945	6696	3488	10580	6279	5585	9611	3491	58472	3855	54465	372	10969	23404	2767	4017	8520	1075	10564	9772	929	23345	7378	26191	7027	1894	825	57513	6432	4071	29923	1234	572	7127	891	10268	8139	6118	10006	1434	64859	10659	3053	10460	3148	10733

Interleukin-5 (IL-5) is a hematopoietic differentiation factor that promotes the development of mature eosinophils from progenitors in bone marrow. We present a multifactorial microarray study documenting the transcriptional events in bone marrow of wild-type and IL-5-deficient mice at baseline and in response to infection with Schistosoma mansoni. The microarray data were analyzed by a 4-way subtractive algorithm that eliminated confounding non-IL-5-related sequelae of schistosome infection as well as alterations in gene expression among uninfected mice. Among the most prominent findings, we observed 7- to 40-fold increased expression of transcripts encoding the classic eosinophil granule proteins (eosinophil peroxidase, major basic protein, the ribonucleases) together with arachidonate-15-lipoxygenase and protease inhibitor plasminogen activator inhibitor 2 (PAI-2), in the IL-5-producing, infected wild-type mice only. This was accompanied by increased transcription of genes involved in secretory protein biosynthesis and granule-vesicle formation. Interestingly, we did not detect increased expression of genes encoding eosinophil-related chemokine receptors (CCR1, CCR3) or members of the GATA or CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBP) transcription factor families. These data suggest that the IL-5-responsive progenitors in the mouse bone marrow are already significantly committed to the eosinophil lineage and that IL-5 promotes differentiation of these committed progenitors into cells with recognizable and characteristic cytoplasmic granules and granule proteins.					5295	11342	23471	55832	3839	4084	10914	5795	405	3097	9782	102	5293	2305	23760	5914	10320	4064	2068	1642	90273	654817	9261	5316	6503	1981	3619	5610	29883	4931	7570	596	57143	3054	7027	23451	9050	5601	1130	960	57396	9031	8776	1536	55106	3683	840	6426	204851	7486	2908	10890	22914	5337	5292	164	6653	103	3572	7112	6777	6045	6850	3684

We used a mouse 16,463 gene oligonucleotide microarray to identify mRNAs whose expression was altered by the overexpression of Hoxc8 in C57BL/6J mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEF) in cell culture (in vitro). We identified a total of 34 genes whose expression was changed by 2-fold or greater: 16 genes were up-regulated, and 18 genes were down-regulated. The majority of genes encoded proteins involved in critical biological processes, such as cell adhesion, migration, metabolism, apoptosis, and tumorigenesis. Two genes showed high levels of regulation: (i) secreted phosphoprotein 1 (Spp1), also known as osteopontin (OPN), was down-regulated 4.8-fold, and (ii) frizzled homolog 2 (Drosophila) (Fzd2) was up-regulated 4.4-fold. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis confirmed the direct interaction between the OPN promoter and Hoxc8 protein in vivo, supporting the view that OPN is a direct transcriptional target of Hoxc8.					9123	7850	6716	22913	133418	1009	5376	10232	54626	2535	6347	6354

Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) have self-renewal capacity and multilineage developmental potentials. The molecular mechanisms that control the self-renewal of HSCs are still largely unknown. Here, a systematic approach using bioinformatics and array hybridization techniques to analyze gene expression profiles in HSCs is described. To enrich mRNAs predominantly expressed in uncommitted cell lineages, 54 000 cDNA clones generated from a highly enriched population of HSCs and a mixed population of stem and early multipotent progenitor (MPP) cells were arrayed on nylon membranes (macroarray or high-density array), and subtracted with cDNA probes derived from mature lineage cells including spleen, thymus, and bone marrow. Five thousand cDNA clones with very low hybridization signals were selected for sequencing and further analysis using microarrays on glass slides. Two populations of cells, HSCs and MPP cells, were compared for differential gene expression using microarray analysis. HSCs have the ability to self-renew, while MPP cells have lost the capacity for self-renewal. A large number of genes that were differentially expressed by enriched populations of HSCs and MPP cells were identified. These included transcription factors, signaling molecules, and previously unknown genes.					5885	3626	3838	7337	2146	1265	5782	5553	113402	6128	23081	801	397	85025	11137	292	3205	4869

Genetically modified mice have been extensively used for analyzing the molecular events that occur during tumor development. In many, if not all, cases, however, it is uncertain to what extent the mouse models reproduce features observed in the corresponding human conditions. This is due largely to lack of precise methods for direct and comprehensive comparison at the molecular level of the mouse and human tumors. Here we use global gene expression patterns of 68 hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) from seven different mouse models and 91 human HCCs from predefined subclasses to obtain direct comparison of the molecular features of mouse and human HCCs. Gene expression patterns in HCCs from Myc, E2f1 and Myc E2f1 transgenic mice were most similar to those of the better survival group of human HCCs, whereas the expression patterns in HCCs from Myc Tgfa transgenic mice and in diethylnitrosamine-induced mouse HCCs were most similar to those of the poorer survival group of human HCCs. Gene expression patterns in HCCs from Acox1(-/-) mice and in ciprofibrate-induced HCCs were least similar to those observed in human HCCs.

Patterns of gene expression in the central nervous system are highly variable and heritable. This genetic variation among normal individuals leads to considerable structural, functional and behavioral differences. We devised a general approach to dissect genetic networks systematically across biological scale, from base pairs to behavior, using a reference population of recombinant inbred strains. We profiled gene expression using Affymetrix oligonucleotide arrays in the BXD recombinant inbred strains, for which we have extensive SNP and haplotype data. We integrated a complementary database comprising 25 years of legacy phenotypic data on these strains. Covariance among gene expression and pharmacological and behavioral traits is often highly significant, corroborates known functional relations and is often generated by common quantitative trait loci. We found that a small number of major-effect quantitative trait loci jointly modulated large sets of transcripts and classical neural phenotypes in patterns specific to each tissue. We developed new analytic and graph theoretical approaches to study shared genetic modulation of networks of traits using gene sets involved in neural synapse function as an example. We built these tools into an open web resource called WebQTL that can be used to test a broad array of hypotheses.					4968	6010	3708	2	339	1911	6529

Detection of individual body time (BT) via a single-time-point assay has been a longstanding unfulfilled dream in medicine, because BT information can be exploited to maximize potency and minimize toxicity during drug administration and thus will enable highly optimized medication. To achieve this dream, we created a molecular timetable composed of >100 time-indicating genes, whose gene expression levels can represent internal BT. Here we describe a robust method called the molecular-timetable method for BT detection from a single-time-point expression profile. The power of this method is demonstrated by the sensitive and accurate detection of BT and the sensitive diagnosis of rhythm disorders. These results demonstrate the feasibility of BT detection based on single-time-point sampling, suggest the potential for expression-based diagnosis of rhythm disorders, and may translate functional genomics into chronotherapy and personalized medicine.					5255	83595	7541	3329	8788	3149	10904	9135	64221	10924	1407	6774	5570	127262	64975	3123	7873	6713	5711	6185	1647	6811	657	6446	56061	5434	202	9975	1628	6004	6431	10263	552	65997	3304	10957	83871	6423	1843	50814	3398	7918	2173	7494	799	551	10808	59338	27338	5502	9709	51760	4124	5935	27229	51655	3021	94101	1723	4616	8864	8522	51807	225	4783	26973	27250	4670	3337	162	3303	9967	55754	594	5187	406	6354	6421	10912	134147	3309	10769	6387	8428	3274	10130	5033	25996

HOUSTIS_ROS	M6891		16612386	Houstis N,Rosen ED,Lander ES		unknown			Mouse430_2	Nick Houstis	Broad Institute	Genes known to modulate ROS or whose expression changes in response to ROS	Insulin resistance is a cardinal feature of type 2 diabetes and is characteristic of a wide range of other clinical and experimental settings. Little is known about why insulin resistance occurs in so many contexts. Do the various insults that trigger insulin resistance act through a common mechanism? Or, as has been suggested, do they use distinct cellular pathways? Here we report a genomic analysis of two cellular models of insulin resistance, one induced by treatment with the cytokine tumour-necrosis factor-alpha and the other with the glucocorticoid dexamethasone. Gene expression analysis suggests that reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels are increased in both models, and we confirmed this through measures of cellular redox state. ROS have previously been proposed to be involved in insulin resistance, although evidence for a causal role has been scant. We tested this hypothesis in cell culture using six treatments designed to alter ROS levels, including two small molecules and four transgenes; all ameliorated insulin resistance to varying degrees. One of these treatments was tested in obese, insulin-resistant mice and was shown to improve insulin sensitivity and glucose homeostasis. Together, our findings suggest that increased ROS levels are an important trigger for insulin resistance in numerous settings.					9588	1356	2495	7295	1545	7001	10549	10935	57466	5052	7498	3263	2880	51022	3162	7296	3240	6385	25828	2512	4502	2879	2878	2876	2730	6649	10587	2936	3163	2877	6647	4489	2745	10628	847	6648

Naive T cells proliferate independently of cognate antigen when introduced into lymphopenic hosts. Lymphopenia-induced proliferation depends on low-affinity MHC/self-peptide complexes and on IL-7. To elucidate the intracellular signals mediating this proliferation, we analyzed changes in gene expression in naive CD8+ T cells at different times after their transfer into a lymphopenic environment. The genes induced in response to lymphopenia were largely an attenuated subset of those turned up by full antigenic stimulation, including genes related to cell cycling, whereas excluding genes specifically associated with effector activity. After the initial phase of proliferation in an empty compartment, the naive T cells adopted a stable pattern of gene expression similar to that of antigen-experienced memory cells. Thus, T cells proliferating in lymphopenic hosts do not exhibit a unique gene-expression profile, instead relying on traditional signals for this antigen-independent proliferation; this process ultimately results in differentiation to authentic memory cells.					2150	5706	54205	5134	9958	8100	10016	390916	90355	9555	120534	28969	56889	115207	2946	11333	8270	1463	5878	81533	1604	6391	7690	81555	3652	64332	2752	22931	55536	53918	55193	596	1660	64841	134147	51321	8320	142679	9791	10123	11315	3654	29978	29928	1869	59338	1070	2876	51095	6319	254013	821	4717	9567	8140	25874	382	10730	5860	7073	138151	533	713	7095	285237	5634	224	440574	2710	9021	7374	280636	22934	3068	4830	10270	23741	55167	55969	81552	5887	6421	11200	50862	1587	6734	5096	8233	10644	53981	140735	6880	2028	133015	7417	8669	64859	26355	8880	705	5578	64432	84105	59286	6635	10728	2764	138241	94081	10360	79101	55907	55651	522	8674	6400	3588	6093	26994	51429	3267	5705	51650	4708	6418	6606	9270	1345	8887	10576	23250	7324	27333	84365	9532	10505	7163	51706	3788	513	1501	10490	351	4709	6653	2584	4646	643836	3476	6801	366	4116	65005	1385	10527	8434	6655	3703	55327	7456	134492	5464	11244	253738	7703	5048	687	27101	3613	4594	4706

Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a switch of polarized epithelial cells to a migratory, fibroblastoid phenotype, is increasingly considered as an important event during malignant tumor progression and metastasis. To identify molecular players involved in EMT and metastasis, we performed expression profiling of a set of combined in vitro/in vivo cellular models, based on clonal, fully polarized mammary epithelial cells. Seven closely related cell pairs were used, which were modified by defined oncogenes and/or external factors and showed specific aspects of epithelial plasticity relevant to cell migration, local invasion and metastasis. Since mRNA levels do not necessarily reflect protein levels in cells, we used an improved expression profiling method based on polysome-bound RNA, suitable to analyse global gene expression on Affymetrix chips. A substantial fraction of all regulated genes was found to be exclusively controlled at the translational level. Furthermore, profiling of the above multiple cell pairs allowed one to identify small numbers of genes by cluster analysis, specifically correlating gene expression with EMT, metastasis, scattering and/or oncogene function. A small set of genes specifically regulated during EMT was identified, including key regulators and signaling pathways involved in cell proliferation, epithelial polarity, survival and trans-differentiation to mesenchymal-like cells with invasive behavior.					3091	9636	5156	6279	1291	4321	567	122622	6678	6383	7378	5742	3371	6772	2326	3075	885	1292	602	26191	6590	6372	5654	871	6237	3437	3339	5376	8635	26227	2619	6520	1281	4921	1000	6347	1634	440	2584	10410	7148	5744	3665	5480	10797	3434	115361	7941	5159	6615	57007	3589	1508	2919	3912	7431	6723	1522	968	4322	10544	6382	100	1545	3624	1448	4313	7436	1013	5118	1601

Transcription factor GATA-1 is required for erythropoiesis, yet its full actions are unknown. We performed transcriptome analysis of G1E-ER4 cells, a GATA-1-null erythroblast line that undergoes synchronous erythroid maturation when GATA-1 activity is restored. We interrogated more than 9000 transcripts at 6 time points representing the transition from late burst forming unit-erythroid (BFU-E) to basophilic erythroblast stages. Our findings illuminate several new aspects of GATA-1 function. First, the large number of genes responding quickly to restoration of GATA-1 extends the repertoire of its potential targets. Second, many transcripts were rapidly down-regulated, highlighting the importance of GATA-1 in gene repression. Third, up-regulation of some known GATA-1 targets was delayed, suggesting that auxiliary factors are required. For example, induction of the direct GATA-1 target gene beta major globin was late and, surprisingly, required new protein synthesis. In contrast, the gene encoding Fog1, which cooperates with GATA-1 in beta globin transcription, was rapidly induced independently of protein synthesis. Guided by bioinformatic analysis, we demonstrated that selected regions of the Fog1 gene exhibit enhancer activity and in vivo occupancy by GATA-1. These findings define a regulatory loop for beta globin expression and, more generally, demonstrate how transcriptome analysis can be used to generate testable hypotheses regarding transcriptional networks.					10661	286	7389	7975	161882	2953	212	2040	2039	6521	23456	3145	7037	210	3050	5498	2512	50865	7390	4778	571	4097

BACKGROUND: Deregulation of the Wnt/ beta-catenin signal transduction pathway has been implicated in the pathogenesis of tumours in the mammary gland, colon and other tissues. Mutations in components of this pathway result in beta-catenin stabilization and accumulation, and the aberrant modulation of beta-catenin/TCF target genes. Such alterations in the cellular transcriptional profile are believed to underlie the pathogenesis of these cancers. We have sought to identify novel target genes of this pathway in mouse mammary epithelial cells. METHODS: Gene expression microarray analysis of mouse mammary epithelial cells inducibly expressing a constitutively active mutant of beta-catenin was used to identify target genes of this pathway. RESULTS: The differential expression in response to DeltaNbeta-catenin for five putative target genes, Autotaxin, Extracellular Matrix Protein 1 (Ecm1), CD14, Hypoxia-inducible gene 2 (Hig2) and Receptor Activity Modifying Protein 3 (RAMP3), was independently validated by northern blotting. Each of these genes encodes either a receptor or a secreted protein, modulation of which may underlie the interactions between Wnt/beta-catenin tumour cells and between the tumour and its microenvironment. One of these genes, Hig2, previously shown to be induced by both hypoxia and glucose deprivation in human cervical carcinoma cells, was strongly repressed upon DeltaNbeta-catenin induction. The predicted N-terminus of Hig2 contains a putative signal peptide suggesting it might be secreted. Consistent with this, a Hig2-EGFP fusion protein was able to enter the secretory pathway and was detected in conditioned medium. Mutation of critical residues in the putative signal sequence abolished its secretion. The expression of human HIG2 was examined in a panel of human tumours and was found to be significantly downregulated in kidney tumours compared to normal adjacent tissue. CONCLUSIONS: HIG2 represents a novel non-cell autonomous target of the Wnt pathway which is potentially involved in human cancer.					57003	79676	5697	7511	2634	54463	25816	3572	23650	1382	81542	6400	2335	3481	55858	1291	55291	63916	3799	81627	3187	1655	4190	6194	54363	9611	1808	9960	920	5530	7033	29789	8239	81688	3842	10628	7077	3693	1893	7874	23197	51366	57658	9373	7095	81892	5168	26502	51592	6389	27067	6496

Patterns of gene expression in the central nervous system are highly variable and heritable. This genetic variation among normal individuals leads to considerable structural, functional and behavioral differences. We devised a general approach to dissect genetic networks systematically across biological scale, from base pairs to behavior, using a reference population of recombinant inbred strains. We profiled gene expression using Affymetrix oligonucleotide arrays in the BXD recombinant inbred strains, for which we have extensive SNP and haplotype data. We integrated a complementary database comprising 25 years of legacy phenotypic data on these strains. Covariance among gene expression and pharmacological and behavioral traits is often highly significant, corroborates known functional relations and is often generated by common quantitative trait loci. We found that a small number of major-effect quantitative trait loci jointly modulated large sets of transcripts and classical neural phenotypes in patterns specific to each tissue. We developed new analytic and graph theoretical approaches to study shared genetic modulation of networks of traits using gene sets involved in neural synapse function as an example. We built these tools into an open web resource called WebQTL that can be used to test a broad array of hypotheses.					23760	28972	22809	4627	4653	10098

Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) have self-renewal capacity and multilineage developmental potentials. The molecular mechanisms that control the self-renewal of HSCs are still largely unknown. Here, a systematic approach using bioinformatics and array hybridization techniques to analyze gene expression profiles in HSCs is described. To enrich mRNAs predominantly expressed in uncommitted cell lineages, 54 000 cDNA clones generated from a highly enriched population of HSCs and a mixed population of stem and early multipotent progenitor (MPP) cells were arrayed on nylon membranes (macroarray or high-density array), and subtracted with cDNA probes derived from mature lineage cells including spleen, thymus, and bone marrow. Five thousand cDNA clones with very low hybridization signals were selected for sequencing and further analysis using microarrays on glass slides. Two populations of cells, HSCs and MPP cells, were compared for differential gene expression using microarray analysis. HSCs have the ability to self-renew, while MPP cells have lost the capacity for self-renewal. A large number of genes that were differentially expressed by enriched populations of HSCs and MPP cells were identified. These included transcription factors, signaling molecules, and previously unknown genes.					7756	8520	4734	9555	378938	474344	3146	23049	5935	57096	26986	5573	4784	826	28978	10659	10574	7461	54165

In many, if not all, cases, however, it is uncertain to what extent the mouse models reproduce features observed in the corresponding human conditions. This is due largely to lack of precise methods for direct and comprehensive comparison at the molecular level of the mouse and human tumors. Here we use global gene expression patterns of 68 hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) from seven different mouse models and 91 human HCCs from predefined subclasses to obtain direct comparison of the molecular features of mouse and human HCCs. Gene expression patterns in HCCs from Myc, E2f1 and Myc E2f1 transgenic mice were most similar to those of the better survival group of human HCCs, whereas the expression patterns in HCCs from Myc Tgfa transgenic mice and in diethylnitrosamine-induced mouse HCCs were most similar to those of the poorer survival group of human HCCs. Gene expression patterns in HCCs from Acox1(-/-) mice and in ciprofibrate-induced HCCs were least similar to those observed in human HCCs. We conclude that our approach can effectively identify appropriate mouse models to study human cancers.					8407	9760	5997	3223	6574	10417	91373	3117	1728	7104	4240	1906	54873	873	55364	1476	308	6698	2169	3959	116496	25797	2879	55350	4061	100133941	1510	1962	4502	3934	10553	25984	3065	5890	3484	11057	6590	325	11138	4023	6446	2114	5327	1284	57419	3485	302	6566	3856	8470	25873	1514	6136	10397	123	5359	54810	2167	967	972	63924	1672	8800	874

Detection of individual body time (BT) via a single-time-point assay has been a longstanding unfulfilled dream in medicine, because BT information can be exploited to maximize potency and minimize toxicity during drug administration and thus will enable highly optimized medication. To achieve this dream, we created a molecular timetable composed of >100 time-indicating genes, whose gene expression levels can represent internal BT. Here we describe a robust method called the molecular-timetable method for BT detection from a single-time-point expression profile. The power of this method is demonstrated by the sensitive and accurate detection of BT and the sensitive diagnosis of rhythm disorders. These results demonstrate the feasibility of BT detection based on single-time-point sampling, suggest the potential for expression-based diagnosis of rhythm disorders, and may translate functional genomics into chronotherapy and personalized medicine.					9099	2194	9898	9516	4860	3006	7088	928	6311	26269	7205	8878	3312	255626	221178	214	2288	127	283600	129303	25798	2149	3175	79071	11261	10979	23710	23014	9563	3664	1581	5465	1050	204	5606	5345	221477	1432	10379	9249	1407	7280	6514	1119	3320	55388	3965	51726	552	3156	9750	1374	10553	406	56261	1717	79081	664	10020	60481	25819	5447	3034	8553	23491	151531	6897	80781	1282	8987	116519	51599	3398	1582	7106	84146	7846	8655	4008	2731	23184	2739	5507	26973	1397	23019	6281	8850	6482	51035	4783	80777	961	10808	2872	366	203068	3308	254013	2729	10171	56912	388324	2246	64225	9368	10298	9601	343	25953	10724	83752	79144	7133	2592	57104	81579	2030	5244	6097	3149	3171	57462	3157	3301	116143	211	5664	9663	7980	435	9709	9967	2224	10376	22809	54760	1051	5935	7803	9076	694	8848	5937	687	3566	8125	1108	153222	2230	2065	23474	647087	55502	4891	8864	10397	9975	8869	3182	130507	3422	10957	4864	1164	11030	2542	9572	9802

Interleukin-5 (IL-5) is a hematopoietic differentiation factor that promotes the development of mature eosinophils from progenitors in bone marrow. We present a multifactorial microarray study documenting the transcriptional events in bone marrow of wild-type and IL-5-deficient mice at baseline and in response to infection with Schistosoma mansoni. The microarray data were analyzed by a 4-way subtractive algorithm that eliminated confounding non-IL-5-related sequelae of schistosome infection as well as alterations in gene expression among uninfected mice. Among the most prominent findings, we observed 7- to 40-fold increased expression of transcripts encoding the classic eosinophil granule proteins (eosinophil peroxidase, major basic protein, the ribonucleases) together with arachidonate-15-lipoxygenase and protease inhibitor plasminogen activator inhibitor 2 (PAI-2), in the IL-5-producing, infected wild-type mice only. This was accompanied by increased transcription of genes involved in secretory protein biosynthesis and granule-vesicle formation. Interestingly, we did not detect increased expression of genes encoding eosinophil-related chemokine receptors (CCR1, CCR3) or members of the GATA or CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBP) transcription factor families. These data suggest that the IL-5-responsive progenitors in the mouse bone marrow are already significantly committed to the eosinophil lineage and that IL-5 promotes differentiation of these committed progenitors into cells with recognizable and characteristic cytoplasmic granules and granule proteins.					9448	6171	2975	9046	4070	6206	11335	23476	57465	2623	51130	64065	5055	7936	10077	1512	246	8673	3068	6176	8288	6134	3066	4924	9026	5928	10394	26088	820	5553	5894	7412	26003	6418	9733	4066	4925	1778	4790	1869	6210	5771	2624	2107	967	5441	3551	10106	6603	3563	6809

Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a switch of polarized epithelial cells to a migratory, fibroblastoid phenotype, is increasingly considered as an important event during malignant tumor progression and metastasis. To identify molecular players involved in EMT and metastasis, we performed expression profiling of a set of combined in vitro/in vivo cellular models, based on clonal, fully polarized mammary epithelial cells. Seven closely related cell pairs were used, which were modified by defined oncogenes and/or external factors and showed specific aspects of epithelial plasticity relevant to cell migration, local invasion and metastasis. Since mRNA levels do not necessarily reflect protein levels in cells, we used an improved expression profiling method based on polysome-bound RNA, suitable to analyse global gene expression on Affymetrix chips. A substantial fraction of all regulated genes was found to be exclusively controlled at the translational level. Furthermore, profiling of the above multiple cell pairs allowed one to identify small numbers of genes by cluster analysis, specifically correlating gene expression with EMT, metastasis, scattering and/or oncogene function. A small set of genes specifically regulated during EMT was identified, including key regulators and signaling pathways involved in cell proliferation, epithelial polarity, survival and trans-differentiation to mesenchymal-like cells with invasive behavior.					8187	81	8650	7078	652	2886	476	8325	1843	3708	1512	1119	8829	5914	4072	760	1500	11240	3664	7074	1572	6446	5317	3400	8789	3693	4627	2354	3397	8091	2152	467	6303	1958	262	3161	10365	11185	604	9391	1490	7057	5590	2316	4254	3728	9138	10769	999	5091	3861	23530	6776	3164	8848	7071	7043	2353	7832	5430	1959	8673	3398	5268	7052	7538

Egr2 is a transcription factor required for peripheral nerve myelination in rodents, and mutations in Egr2 are associated with congenital hypomyelinating neuropathy (CHN) in humans. To further study its role in myelination, we generated mice harboring a hypomorphic Egr2 allele (Egr2Lo) that survive for up to 3 weeks postnatally, a period of active myelination in rodents. These Egr2Lo/Lo mice provided the opportunity to study the molecular effects of Egr2 deficiency on Schwann cell biology, an analysis that was not possible previously, because of the perinatal lethality of Egr2-null mice. Egr2Lo/Lo mice phenocopy CHN, as evidenced by the severe hypomyelination and increased numbers of proliferating Schwann cells of the peripheral nerves. Comparison of sciatic nerve gene expression profiles during development and after crush injury with those of Egr2Lo/Lo Schwann cells revealed that they are developmentally arrested, with down-regulation of myelination-related genes and up-regulation of genes associated with immature and promyelinating Schwann cells. One of the abnormally elevated genes in Egr2Lo/Lo Schwann cells, Sox2, encodes a transcription factor that is crucial for maintenance of neural stem cell pluripotency. Wild-type Schwann cells infected with Sox2 adenovirus or lentivirus inhibited expression of myelination-associated genes (e.g., myelin protein zero; Mpz), and failed to myelinate axons in vitro, but had an enhanced proliferative response to beta-neuregulin. The characterization of a mouse model of CHN has provided insight into Schwann cell differentiation and allowed the identification of Sox2 as a negative regulator of myelination.					7430	200734	55269	10112	6119	1164	28969	7852	29089	5151	29128	6241	3838	4082	3066	4162	57650	991	11004	128239	1028	84617	960	6347	4173	1894	10733	9133	2113	92521	2044	65108	4085	467	1163	3015	80781	9547	3835	7398	5933	64943	280636	3371	5935	983	3014	699	7153	26472	8091	5347	5025	6790	5453	3619	9497	4288	55143	890	286827	51177	23234	7071	51203	4176	65055	9055	2146	332	51155	3148	9493	27022	8317	891	5985	23705	9768	79004	6457	63979	23397	23603	286826	10409	3832	4001	23521	6240	6657	3398	23406	55651	1910	10592	595	4174	63027	10752	55714	89797	27242	5888	3181	57819	6941	1466

We combined large-scale mRNA expression analysis and gene mapping to identify genes and loci that control hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) function. We measured mRNA expression levels in purified HSCs isolated from a panel of densely genotyped recombinant inbred mouse strains. We mapped quantitative trait loci (QTLs) associated with variation in expression of thousands of transcripts. By comparing the physical transcript position with the location of the controlling QTL, we identified polymorphic cis-acting stem cell genes. We also identified multiple trans-acting control loci that modify expression of large numbers of genes. These groups of coregulated transcripts identify pathways that specify variation in stem cells. We illustrate this concept with the identification of candidate genes involved with HSC turnover. We compared expression QTLs in HSCs and brain from the same mice and identified both shared and tissue-specific QTLs. Our data are accessible through WebQTL, a web-based interface that allows custom genetic linkage analysis and identification of coregulated transcripts.					11328	999	8566	1046	22938	3068	4958	6665	10526	3614	5362	1606	8650	3198	60386	391013	127933	5612	8777	10573	3890	1453	54898	5753	50814	842	9421	3015	5715	5125	54529	10285	92822	5786	3284	6351	9241	26287	10672	8289	1747	6813	7480	3952	9451	26515	9669	6444	9377	666	1440	401505	399	7276	51642	117246	4086	64400	23383	55048	6927	23316	3800	5460	2192	4646	126961	7436	8395	645832	138716	3351	190	23557	1769	138151	60558	11011	54948	5965	1105	23654	8662	1496	27010	8932	8842	6228	6850	9370	526	9604	2339	54810	23476	23405	51421	56890	1312	9869	476	3801	3785	9673	7306	5901	6620	26057	5598	5695	54936	4673	283120	6603	84519	5639	64645	5295	3685	7289	79932	5130	4794	673	1001	51117	3831	2353	51668	824	1356	3572	9975	54534	10174	977	3507	4062	54433	3537	4735	1791	102	3598	6737	23554	388419	11137	1728	3357	9672	7412	1146	677	2940	2040	3394	80139	6418	5288	26100	116541	7329	6780	114112	7105	4014	54491	3695	3991	159	114883	79191	26229	8870	231	7043	7414	2520	2752	4948	23327	9406	5707	26227	23187	23564	1033	3455	157567	54838	238	2331	4155	1544	377	51490	25988	64429	84293	55333	8428	23039	56061	4758	80031	3593	94	285527	9926	8484	9520	10106	2876	5985	1645	2992	23608	84146	54700	317772	1632	10930	6817	1024	147007	8935	6510	10755	9230	2209	126382	23609	63036	1308	10250	973	3231	51293	728	51203	1159	779	92305	8786	283	10287	8313	7456	2099	3188	4214	9435	947	125965	3053	253738	8706	56916	81572	64180	3184	80155	610	292	6242	92359	948	7010	7976	4326	5345	2668	8509	5373	22859	835	4841	4878	644096	23410	3739	64786	51228	6050	51130	7476	7511	3006	5730	8548	55854	657	8600	6348	10313	1778	5708	128821	80347	6774	5738	2494	7357	10637	51026	761	23541	5241	3320	3557	23313	5654	114879	55692	29888	3146	26521	140733	6770	10413	57455	929	2260	3178	7478	2028	64222	8760	7075	2984	8550	6885	29956	5087	204	3992	1045	8854	2063	1500	51091	4883	27351	63940	2997	6657	2593	821	2793	7390	4802	83877	11196	5624	3017	404093	29984	2692	134492	10945	115	865	55793	9150	28960	64283	256126	4542	3036	11020	4729	29089	90410	1856	9659	53916	55975	2107	51382	5862	728229	28998	55527	23473	23075	3699	85460	401152	9173	23129	1004	5195	290	4336	9167	51706	10494	8671	943	9218	8817	3267	9397	23613	3632	2947	2553	224	9277	90273	7014	51606	191	8087	23468	7703	5356	10312	5912	4308	9570	648	54602	1555	92400	2935	57007	2674	1741	126119	54093	7448	148362	79031	4602	7182	55577	79876	3516	670	5293	5830	5768	3596	11179	1788	9739	134510	1408	104	689	55892	11030	1282	3010	29855	7424	5717	6334	10410	7423	3485	54793	51329	3627	10247	5438	3398	4747	63943	4124	1587	9232	58515	9557	4331	2521	7037	140885	7350	8742	991	9266	54776	8973	9973	54518	7052	9258	10746	5898	7291	133015	429	4967	2953	6182	23759	9111	6375	146861	5436	7132	4298	6609	2856	4190	8651	64710	3214	4004	6118	5049	57820	9988	211	6560	255743	7343	4887	8438	8809	8030	8312	3269	10842	2971	10068	341947	2622	5801	29934	22914	55277	10425	1454	57697	25930	8729	6499	10236	10713	51103	6093	3384	6717	84258	23218	1773	9868	148479	112936	3758	6324	1314	7189	3984	3929	441282	140453	5063	57630	27429	2290	10923	284307	10419	7409	8766	5132	219972	56998	23456	8773	3216	51533	310	867	962	2155	4620	7113	23	84272	53615	30001	5349	4430	10092	5884	158	221092	2475	10775	5896	3381	54407	51701	126282	389434	4603	5133	4784	4644	80303	3655	26145	26190	9782	8453	3175	3960	51440	10463	9567	7259	1852	5863	139728	5660	8568	958	440957	1386	8733	9337	80206	6004	28512	763	8913	5094	10586	57541	8900	146542	64419	4481	3560	10282	51388	57396	3001	694	23028	8738	9209	23042	56654	780	23559	3980	55737	8888	10156	9464	9403	7844	3218	373156	2222	5537	80818	9862	7007	3329	921	710	1200	4201	3849	4116	9194	3054	5893	23160	10922	3690	10228	5798	4354	9733	1636	2239	9919	6452	4723	6453	358	161436	55536	2901	1399	23236	353	51639	11329	2212	5737	55210	8239	4094	155061	51450	6671	23371	4000	2101	6778	687	9929	79016	57095	637	3064	7140	7336	1303	63979	513	128240	6347	54606	6198	51094	11056	11202	9410	51574	79643	51715	51205	6833	1054	140683	7266	2906	55038	51	222642	699	28996	440	9275	9419	6037	6810	7025	9817	1286	10776	3607	5145	29842	10845	7006	4684	4586	9420	6480	116832	10983	3751	2317	7056	3551	1603	29887	9533	25921	5432	4861	6925	79670	2137	100506736	972	1892	25847	6929	51268	2890	1737	376497	56243	10869	56261	79575	2702	2022	4741	6790	389203	360163	7982	23440	65993	112	5395	9846	54458	968	7532	8506	2739	65055	23173	26086	51738	1036	529	4750	3613	57045	4222	7054	6343	8884	23558	80317	7020	11194	8507	203069	136227	388585	3703	4717	3851	10481	51176	112464	552	1660	79153	6916	9016	3199	8545	5136	51114	2905	7173	57633	8292	11315	2547	2897	5573	10146	64118	65264	84259	1465	55572	7846	1906	487	6300	3300	10580	55806	3623	84248	347252	8520	3052	6837	6809	1908	2778	2116	10772	84787	2069	9145	6046	4790	8459	4071	8190

Lymphopenia-induced proliferation depends on low-affinity MHC/self-peptide complexes and on IL-7. To elucidate the intracellular signals mediating this proliferation, we analyzed changes in gene expression in naive CD8+ T cells at different times after their transfer into a lymphopenic environment. The genes induced in response to lymphopenia were largely an attenuated subset of those turned up by full antigenic stimulation, including genes related to cell cycling, whereas excluding genes specifically associated with effector activity. After the initial phase of proliferation in an empty compartment, the naive T cells adopted a stable pattern of gene expression similar to that of antigen-experienced memory cells. Thus, T cells proliferating in lymphopenic hosts do not exhibit a unique gene-expression profile, instead relying on traditional signals for this antigen-independent proliferation; this process ultimately results in differentiation to authentic memory cells.					8434	10505	9531	10787	6237	51129	10580	57146	54985	1632	6103	2272	3601	5621	55975	2817	56172	8492	10156	6655	5627	27333	5463	26191	118429	3587	79145	11126	50484	2217	4855	6513	5151	6038	5581	23348	7185	5590	366	6300	23175	5333	27143	114609	7703	5243	56994	85014	85457	64393	79001	54477	1521	115207	9975	8320	2710	51444	255231	84196	7443	3588	2149	3455	285440

Human infertility and recurrent pregnancy loss caused by implantation defects are poorly understood. Hoxa-10-deficient female mice have severe infertility and recurrent pregnancy loss due to defective uterine implantation. Gene expression profiling experiments reveal that Hoxa-10 is an important regulator of two critical events in implantation: stromal cell proliferation and local immunosuppression. At the time of implantation, Hoxa-10 mediates the progesterone-stimulated proliferation of uterine stromal cells. Hoxa-10 mutants express a stromal cell proliferation defect that is accompanied by quantitative or spatial alterations in the expression of two cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor genes, p57 and p15. Hoxa-10 deficiency also leads to a severe local immunological disturbance, characterized by a polyclonal proliferation of T cells, that occurs in place of the normal progesterone-mediated immunosuppression in the periimplantation uterus.					284023	761	5090	28954	55384	5168	1628	1441	7881	7071	348	79009	4057	4199	3908	3866	54361	7148	151613	7122	10523	6926	9370	8706	1028	4211	5919	3119	2321	60	728392	2621	596	4681	112487	7498	3397	6038	1571	2669	11185	133	79447	56961	3418	2952	477	358	10630	7069	3164	7056	3934	57447	3156	5947	5627	10124	2006	8436	55015	4684	26993	1675	26054	1014	1572	79153	5295	2940	55850	23371	687	29950	376497	3953	3486	1397	5178

Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) mediates the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal stress response. Transgenic mice overexpressing LIF in the developing pituitary have altered pituitary differentiation with expansion of corticotropes, maintenance of Rathke's cleft cysts, and suppression of all other pituitary cell types. Affymetrix GeneChips were used to identify modulators of LIF effects in corticotrope (AtT-20) and somatolactotrope (GH(3)) cells. In addition to genes known to respond to LIF in corticotrope cells [e.g. suppressor of cytokine signaling-3 (SOCS-3), signal transducer and activator of transcription-3, SH2 domain-containing tyrosine phosphatase-1, and proopiomelanocortin (POMC)], corticotrope-specific changes were also observed for genes involved in glycolysis and gluconeogenesis, transcription factors, signaling molecules, and expressed sequence tags. Two transcription factors identified, CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein beta (C/EBPbeta) and glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF)-inducible factor (GIF), dose-dependently induced expression of the rat POMC promoter when overexpressed in AtT-20 cells. LIF further induced POMC transcription with C/EBPbeta, but not with GIF. C/EBPbeta also induced expression of the SOCS-3 promoter that was further enhanced by cotreatment with LIF. However, GIF did not affect SOCS-3 expression. These results indicate that C/EBPbeta and GIF are downstream effectors of LIF corticotrope action. LIF also stimulates the expression of inhibitors of its actions, such as SOCS-3 and SH2 domain-containing tyrosine phosphatase-1. alpha(2)-HS-glycoprotein (AHSG)/fetuin, a secreted protein that antagonizes bone TGFbeta/bone morphogenic protein signaling, was induced by LIF in a signal transducer and activator of transcription-3-dependent fashion. Pretreatment with AHSG/fetuin blocked LIF-induced expression of the POMC promoter independently of SOCS-3. Thus, using GeneChips, C/EBPbeta and GIF have been identified as novel mediators and AHSG/fetuin as an inhibitor of LIF action in corticotropes.					25996	8803	92154	80344	146556	6275	3170	91369	1644	594	94121	10753	3225	3987	23191	7102	3099	3655	214	79026	1943	100133941	57162	26578	5168	2891

Mechanisms controlling the balance between proliferation and self-renewal versus growth suppression and differentiation during normal and leukemic myelopoiesis are not understood. We have used the bi-potent FDB1 myeloid cell line model, which is responsive to myelopoietic cytokines and activated mutants of the granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) receptor, having differential signaling and leukemogenic activity. This model is suited to large-scale gene-profiling, and we have used a factorial time-course design to generate a substantial and powerful data set. Linear modeling was used to identify gene-expression changes associated with continued proliferation, differentiation, or leukemic receptor signaling. We focused on the changing transcription factor profile, defined a set of novel genes with potential to regulate myeloid growth and differentiation, and demonstrated that the FDB1 cell line model is responsive to forced expression of oncogenes identified in this study. We also identified gene-expression changes associated specifically with the leukemic GM-CSF receptor mutant, V449E. Signaling from this receptor mutant down-regulates CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein alpha (C/EBPalpha) target genes and generates changes characteristic of a specific acute myeloid leukemia signature, defined previously by gene-expression profiling and associated with C/EBPalpha mutations.					283131	64115	87	6646	717	7940	1475	728	50856	6137	202243	3906	4317	51734	820	5291	25851	4430	3553	84649	2040	634	4084	945	1362	6120	3726	30814	10487	54758	1438	4170	2992	51296	2934	8895	1520	55748	950	2947	4973	5836	9050	4842	2814	219285	94241	5340	214	894	307	5226	57488	308	54827	54209	66037	597	6277	122258	2069	10399	6672	3927	645638	7140	718	2532	8826	1536	55848	1728	1318	6282	8560	825	199675	51099	6303	2907	9076	2745	140885	3398	166929	7124	7378	150372	290	5329	7132	462	1052	2539	225	7850	1601	10085	1263	259307	7045	3689	5768	7791	529	23601	83639	497189	7097	93978	55106	2357	84569	1265	51705	7367	7498	79095	118429	9980	3074	11034	50865	90273	2268	1958	1043	941	50650	3557	2358	27036	3934	526	729230	4864	313	114827	6533	6038	3055	3142	152007	5595	8115	100506736	3687	960	55676	219972	2209	10748	3684	10913	2159	5413	968	2212	7226	2896	1230	822	6218	2799	7305

Obesity is strongly correlated with type 2 diabetes mellitus, a common disorder of glucose and lipid metabolism. Although adipocytes are critical in obesity, their role in diabetes has only recently been appreciated. We conducted studies by using DNA microarrays to identify differences in gene expression in adipose tissue from lean, obese, and obese-diabetic mice. The expression level of over 11,000 transcripts was analyzed, and 214 transcripts showed significant differences between lean and obese mice. Surprisingly, the expression of genes normally associated with adipocyte differentiation were down-regulated in obesity. Not all obese individuals will become diabetic; many remain normoglycemic despite profound obesity. Understanding the transition to obesity with concomitant diabetes will provide important clues to the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes. Therefore, we examined the levels of gene expression in adipose tissue from five groups of obese mice with varying degrees of hyperglycemia, and we identified 88 genes whose expression strongly correlated with diabetes severity. This group included many genes that are known to be involved in signal transduction and energy metabolism as well as genes not previously examined in the context of diabetes. Our data show that a decrease in expression of genes normally involved in adipogenesis is associated with obesity, and we further identify genes important for subsequent development of type 2 diabetes mellitus.					2212	7351	1513	1152	528	5660	5641	1072	53827	2199	6396	4282	2316	7171	5476	4240	241	7163	3929	3952	4738	6993	1843	26986	123	5216	5176	1514	10437	1436	1476	6404	7094	3059	1520	1410	1603	1277	1509	1522	963	219972	713	4502	822	968	8682	2207	2896	7805	5360	4035	10631	3429	10409	5306	23646	1508	4360	3958	633

Critically, for the first time we confirm a series of Wnt target molecules in an in vivo setting and also identify a series of new candidate targets within the same setting.					9547	970	6001	5948	5997	122618	7036	288	6943	3659	80168	1610	10791	10062	5450	2879	923	6750	3938	397	3988	5590	127	2767	2641	3620	925	7535	4891	6494	3507	10007	28971	6097	3662	2323	5414	3512	5959	654817	54602	2819	4214	5465	3687	51006	8714	7087	9032	1644	57465	1287	7903	5293	56994	2538	11151	9326	51667	1840	144717	13	22823	5791	4212	54345	51150	55034	6376	63924	3682	6400	6514	714	1636	10803	7421	7011	6793	1908	9770	10563	79083	11346	58476	4248	4258	10263	2687	56136	2664	23428	839	1521	2799	720	30851	3090	355	124221	670	3594	7166	1043	4051	8545	5051	885	608	5639	63940	9936	3500	11155	9970	533	4065	3002	6480	5880	23545	4337	84293	90411	140885	1603	4601	348035	115817	963	168544	8694	5125	1181	7849	29785	140809	4066	6649	56654	10551	8538	9099	686	84299	6532	2941	860	8608	1727	2053	4967	5152	23526	1376	917	7092	8625	3683	8900	1039	3001	91703	752	2952	924	3029	4189	1384	4969	215	1800	9641	8857	80781	116840	7378	9435	8557	5618	51177	1805	4225	10140	11136	9060	653808	6689	445347	6820	3695	4883	7305	489	10788	6590	89846	79575	971	6352	6397	2835	1030	389	5118	3689	51268	1773	1047	23259	1346	5967	535	6988	2168	933	1606	213	8728	921	7003	51738	5002	940	9817	825	6284	3635	3560	3767	26	9926	6370	2947	2907	4921	57835	23541	954	56848	51	5552	481	5950	1215	5360	4035	55568	1907	757	2073	22933	23457	6484	10999	3384	7410	3109	155066	136	10461	7704	7040	973	29	8425	957	7045	27141	4046	57143	6523	3112	3732	4259	3717	6610	115584	8844	4681	79602	8435	915	29851	2695	962	836	30	4547	2634	9476	23040	10237	25987	309	914	91107	1241	3595	5091	10753	8650	373156	5635	762	6404	2324	4343	8729	2678	53841	384	8671	26999	55640	410	23558	11126	8611	55303	54097	28512	4774	916	55856	6518	22924	1032	7805	7462	6583	130589	8530	1600	5788	2173	652	3606	83636	5184	7409	54	134147	1146	3991	974	1594	840	1528	10409	8506	56605	55177	2123	3106	3675	58528	79784	6920	2560	200931	2781	4647	1244	7498	834

With the goal of creating a resource for in-depth study of myelopoiesis, we have executed a 2-pronged strategy to obtain a complementary DNA (cDNA) clone set enriched in hematopoietic genes. One aspect is a library subtraction to enrich for underrepresented transcripts present at early stages of hematopoiesis. For this, a hematopoietic cDNA library from primary murine bone marrow cells enriched for primitive progenitors was used as tester. The subtraction used 10 000 known genes and expressed sequence tags (ESTs) as driver. The 2304 randomly picked clones from the subtracted cDNA libraries represent 1255 distinct genes, of which 622 (50%) are named genes, 386 (30%) match uncharacterized ESTs, and 247 (20%) are novel. The second aspect of our strategy was to complement this subtracted library with genes known to be involved in myeloid cell differentiation and function. The resulting cDNAs were arrayed on polylysine-coated glass slides. The microarrays were used to analyze gene expression in primary and cultured murine bone marrow-derived progenitors. We found expression of various types of genes, including regulatory cytokines and their receptors, signal transduction genes, and transcription factors. To assess gene expression during myeloid differentiation, we examined patterns of change during induced differentiation of EML cells. Several hundred of the genes underwent fluctuations in expression level during myeloid cell differentiation. The complete database, accessible on the World Wide Web at http://yale130132115135.med.yale.edu/, allows for retrieval of information regarding these genes. Our microarray allows for genomewide expression analysis of myeloid stem cells, which will help in defining the regulatory mechanisms of stem cell differentiation.					7525	23616	1839	5704	4775	7763	2355	26524	3516	10672	5496	7941	3238	5610	7709	2775	3214	321	3172	26191	23095	967	6775	3001	4851	6927	7410	4904	929	4089	10370	10661	7494	3196	5055	5153	7412	1493	1384	6347	27022	3306	900	2353

A cytotoxic enterotoxin (Act) of Aeromonas hydrophila possesses several biological activities, and it induces an inflammatory response in the host. In this study, we used microarrays to gain a global and molecular view of the cellular transcriptional responses to Act and to identify important genes up-regulated by this toxin. Total RNA was isolated at 0, 2, and 12 h from Act-treated macrophages and applied to Affymetrix MGU74 arrays, and the data were processed using a multi-analysis approach to identify genes that might be critical in the inflammatory process evoked by Act. Seventy-six genes were significantly and consistently up-regulated. Many of these genes were immune-related, and several were transcription factors, adhesion molecules, and cytokines. Additionally, we identified several apoptosis-associated genes that were significantly up-regulated in Act-treated macrophages. Act-induced apoptosis of macrophages was confirmed by annexin V staining and DNA laddering. Quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay were used to verify increased expression of some inflammatory and apoptosis-associated genes identified by the microarray analysis. To further confirm Act-induced increases in gene expression, real-time RT-PCR was also used for selected genes. Taken together, the array data provided for the first time a global view of Act-mediated signal transduction and clearly demonstrated an inflammatory response and apoptosis mediated by this toxin in host cells at the molecular level.					4791	1051	5743	8061	6239	6351	388	1959	8870	10318	10628	4953	54206	7124	71	10018	23580	5292	597	5155	100506736	960	7422	5329	1844	929	116143	6352	83931	1843	23187	5315	5880	9308	8744	65108	3553	6734	5099	8553	22822	4792	8878	9641	4790	9021	6892	2597	25819	730249	1647	3383	9709	7128	7127	81671	4616	7185	8807	1439	6556	5154	5791	136	4502	10938	8848	255877	2745	1440	9260	6348	55106	8915	6319	4665	602	3678	6696	2920	7314	2114	3557	7316	3726

The first hematopoietic and endothelial progenitors are derived from a common embryonic precursor termed the hemangioblast. The genetic cascades that regulate the differentiation of the hemangioblast to hematopoietic and endothelial cells are largely unknown. In general, much of embryonic development is coordinately regulated by temporal and spatial expression of transcription factors, such as the Homeobox (Hox) gene family. We and others isolated a divergent homeobox gene termed Hex (or Prh) that is preferentially expressed in hematopoietic and endothelial cells. Using in vitro Hex-/- embryonic stem (ES) cell differentiation, in vivo yolk sac hematopoietic progenitor assays, and chimeric mouse analysis, we found that Hex is required for differentiation of the hemangioblast to definitive embryonic hematopoietic progenitors and to a lesser extent endothelial cells. Therefore, Hex is a novel regulator of hemangioblast differentiation to hematopoietic and endothelial cells.					22823	80155	2077	4267	51631	4323	5783	10270	8829	7337	1943	3977	5727	81605	8609	6311	64400	966	2199	1730	4692	3671	79692	1944	5108	2734	26136	6423	80014	170506	5228	7403	6304	5826	80232	6533	27131	2785	410	6667	8322	56943	25937	2901	7422	2011	54918	55384	54551	2043	5451	4826	6252	6907	79071	6491	6926	5770	58528	5813	3480	9584	5870	687	54928	523	5978	3267	6664	5728	2245	652	6599	808	8826	10421	9590	2131	7703	463	6432

Meis1 is a homeodomain transcription factor coexpressed with Hoxa9 in most human acute myeloid leukemias (AMLs). In mouse models of leukemia produced by Hoxa9, Meis1 accelerates leukemogenesis. Because Hoxa9 immortalizes myeloid progenitors in the absence of Meis1 expression, the contribution of Meis1 toward leukemia remains unclear. Here, we describe a cultured progenitor model in which Meis1 programs leukemogenicity. Progenitors immortalized by Hoxa9 in culture are myeloid-lineage restricted and only infrequently caused leukemia after more than 250 days. Coexpressed Meis1 programmed rapid AML-initiating character, maintained multipotent progenitor potential, and induced expression of genes associated with short-term hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), such as FLT3 and CD34, whose expression also characterizes the leukemia-initiating stem cells of human AML. Meis1 leukemogenesis functions required binding to Pbx, binding to DNA, and a conserved function of its C-terminal tail. We hypothesize that Meis1 is required for the homing and survival of leukemic progenitors within their hematopoietic niches, functions mediated by HSC-specific genes such as CD34 and Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3), respectively. This is the first example of a transcription factor oncoprotein (Meis1) that establishes expression of a tyrosine kinase oncoprotein (FLT3), and explains their coexpression in human leukemia. This cultured progenitor model will be useful to define the genetic basis of leukemogenesis involving Hoxa9 and Meis1.					220323	51744	8848	10203	8204	4900	22918	5790	3575	1879	9450	9289	7704	2078	51523	947	6304	2669	4211	1909	939	2322	3695	9168

The involvement of the c-Myc transcription factor in neoplastic transformation is well documented. However, which of its numerous target genes are crucial for tumorigenesis remains a frequently contested issue. We have recently established a non-transgenic murine model for B-cell lymphoma based on neoplastic conversion of p53-null bone marrow cells by conditionally active Myc. Using this model, we have identified a number of genes whose expression levels are affected by Myc during B-lymphomagenesis. Here we discuss their possible roles in neoplastic processes and describe an experimental approach allowing in vivo validation of these roles. We demonstrate that lymphoma cells overexpressing one of the Myc targets, the interleukin-10 receptor gene, have a very strong selective advantage over low IL10R expressors. Furthermore, Mcl1, a presumptive IL10R effector, also confers selective advantages when overexpressed in Myc-transformed hematopoietic cells. Thus, both IL10R and Mcl1 might be amenable to therapeutic interventions, and new targets can be identified and validated using the selection approach.					9133	51377	3148	10112	1894	92906	51514	891	699	27338	332	3422	2224	5347	7153	9768	79733	51053	675	53371	84908	6790	7027	4288	1164	7295	29127	1033	11171	134492	54443	1687	7106	3838	259266	6240	25932	8531	5111	983	79077	1163

Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) have self-renewal capacity and multilineage developmental potentials. The molecular mechanisms that control the self-renewal of HSCs are still largely unknown. Here, a systematic approach using bioinformatics and array hybridization techniques to analyze gene expression profiles in HSCs is described. To enrich mRNAs predominantly expressed in uncommitted cell lineages, 54 000 cDNA clones generated from a highly enriched population of HSCs and a mixed population of stem and early multipotent progenitor (MPP) cells were arrayed on nylon membranes (macroarray or high-density array), and subtracted with cDNA probes derived from mature lineage cells including spleen, thymus, and bone marrow. Five thousand cDNA clones with very low hybridization signals were selected for sequencing and further analysis using microarrays on glass slides. Two populations of cells, HSCs and MPP cells, were compared for differential gene expression using microarray analysis. HSCs have the ability to self-renew, while MPP cells have lost the capacity for self-renewal. A large number of genes that were differentially expressed by enriched populations of HSCs and MPP cells were identified. These included transcription factors, signaling molecules, and previously unknown genes.					4515	6427	51150	5108	11011	10162	51176	6348	4067	2122	4211	5921	26057	5930	6749	4201	338917	9212	23204	51629	4778	4170	4851	65125	1997	7763	2323	4818	9043	55870	57396	53335	3815	5997	11315	6925	10552	23468	23582	648	4046	902	1657	7805

Valpha14i natural killer T (NKT)-cell function has been implicated in a number of disease conditions. The molecular events that drive Valpha14i NKT-cell development remain elusive. We recently showed that T-bet is required for the terminal maturation of these cells. Here we identify some of the genetic targets of T-bet during Valpha14i NKT-cell lineage development. Microarray gene-expression analyses on developing Valpha14i NKT cells were performed and provide a molecular framework to study these maturation events. In vitro ectopic expression of T-bet in immature Valpha14i NKT cells, which do not yet express T-bet, was sufficient to promote Valpha14i NKT-cell maturation, driving the expression of multiple genes, including those that participate in migration, survival, and effector functions. By regulating the expression of T-helper 1 (Th1)-associated cytokines, chemokines, chemokine receptors, and molecules involved in cytolysis, T-bet defines the unique lineage attributes of mature Valpha14i NKT cells and acts to link these attributes to a developmental process.					79188	116541	5719	7289	1019	5534	6443	1525	84302	10254	10290	3835	26227	91860	4739	83478	80255	85440	6767	3821	6610	3382	3824	1879	23462	4172	127544	8519	10875	3276	6564	6531	5211	11126	4534	84293	57758	55617	10987	5976	55847	27244	5704	814	3553	3596	89941	9750	999	55799	54997	2045	79026	4322	6567	1316	64506	5329	123	10239	2619	10461	55593	57823	7813	4065	85476	5795	259230	5318	54555	84102	3459	8896	55153	4171	10085	10901	54829	1234	55627	3092	7571	4644	6527	9314	23360	26524	919	83439	10286	80774	54865	948	53346	5396	64919	1329	1362	8434	767	8697	3080	6319	5756	8644	6352	5150	6608	9223	54984	49854	51611	636	23136	151648	7086	56776	51744	55553	55210	226	9455	51678	26150	7525	3925	7088	6423	4174	701	64849	960	3008	127281	55117	5394	6303	10608	2277	113189	5359	6182	83699	3487	54855	7456	3764	924	7018	9476	4988	5609	10803	10180	729515	65983	6785	10418	115207	6446	6453	2833	2149	26191	4522	8858	5792	516	55754	3688	84002	57679	4839	356	6472	30009	1591	8835	10581	219972	10492	6493	3725	3269	9936	22914	4716	10142	6749	667	2353	83743	3627	9522	5866	860	8019	3832	7082	5428	7037	1841	60	3182	6301	8553	6925	9569	9580	30000	1102	3320	1509	23150	7704	646	1179	359845	1230	2941	5558	9801	10574	11183	4643	4176	23457	3002	23534	25937	3026	1310	6659	5602	10579	3400	8029	51232	7353	2273	10159	23787	6351	25801	5169	3945	8323	5243	5058	9049	2280	5217	54585	331	23052	84058	55651	10465	8653	79711	441687	10402	1831	8721	5168	9249	8208	116449	11328	4542	65108	91663	2150	55151	85463	5527	2042	10460	4916	56548	47	6302	2584	255231	6222	79705	158219	8607	1769	124944	2957	382	64151	56912	7138	55176	6671	9402	4900	2591	9900	6775	29066	57590	1108	440	10891	22983	148281	6241	11151	3399	2583	64425	4208	6698	4261	80777	401612	4691	8507	1992	166785	196	2237	55576	6375	8693	252983	8626	3560	286828	2857	10165	10196	5533	1465	9975	23223	51514	3512	4121	56259	2316	5817	3458	283120	10631	7083	114609	26279	165324	2554	196463	402778	3073	117531	2920	6932	1829	8914	7743	79723	3290	11188	64320	23095	5165	301	2022	58538	5789	3479	9918	147495	4145	23604	3818	197322	256126	54843	10663	29969	51317	7098	11098	2687	1236	9021	126353	389	2783	113130	6777	7167	2821	220134	7421	29775	10969	26517	3783	10121	3209	1832	1130	7039	10417	80755	5315	150275	10471	2202	57414	4925	54751	220323	54414	1448	23400	9066	952	23705	374618	10454	5325	6897	6653	84100	26224	56937	2669	2288	51082	221955	2059	84525	8438	529	137964	8572	23308	1301	5531	5551	785	768211	6196	64641	5902	6208	64978	11035	6059	347733	84303	4613	4818	9211	23759	7415	23300	7337	5133	30061	23258	93436	9450	1984	152503	5743	3304	5996	80014

Chromosomal translocations that fuse the mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) gene with multiple partners typify acute leukemias of infancy as well as therapy-related leukemias. We utilized a conditional knockin strategy to bypass the embryonic lethality caused by MLL-CBP expression and to assess the immediate effects of induced MLL-CBP expression on hematopoiesis. Within days of activating MLL-CBP, the fusion protein selectively expanded granulocyte/macrophage progenitors (GMP) and enhanced their self-renewal/proliferation. MLL-CBP altered the gene expression program of GMP, upregulating a subset of genes including Hox a9. Inhibition of Hox a9 expression by RNA interference demonstrated that MLL-CBP required Hox a9 for its enhanced cell expansion. Following exposure to sublethal gamma-irradiation or N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU), MLL-CBP mice developed myelomonocytic hyperplasia and progressed to fatal myeloproliferative disorders. These represented the spectrum of therapy-induced acute myelomonocytic leukemia/chronic myelomonocytic leukemia/myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative disorder similar to that seen in humans possessing the t(11;16). This model of MLL-CBP therapy-related myeloproliferative disease demonstrates the selectivity of this MLL fusion for GMP cells and its ability to initiate leukemogenesis in conjunction with cooperating mutations.					1362	1990	10991	400451	201161	10411	50618	51588	7412	3205	9857	23345	3592	4489	55374	7182	1769	2159	55353	8751	2817	9934	7805	8993	6793	7534	929	83706	65003	529	109	2734	54676	4684	116844	23095	6769	7430	6477	2123	6001	645638	79627	26995

The first hematopoietic and endothelial progenitors are derived from a common embryonic precursor termed the hemangioblast. The genetic cascades that regulate the differentiation of the hemangioblast to hematopoietic and endothelial cells are largely unknown. In general, much of embryonic development is coordinately regulated by temporal and spatial expression of transcription factors, such as the Homeobox (Hox) gene family. We and others isolated a divergent homeobox gene termed Hex (or Prh) that is preferentially expressed in hematopoietic and endothelial cells. Using in vitro Hex-/- embryonic stem (ES) cell differentiation, in vivo yolk sac hematopoietic progenitor assays, and chimeric mouse analysis, we found that Hex is required for differentiation of the hemangioblast to definitive embryonic hematopoietic progenitors and to a lesser extent endothelial cells. Therefore, Hex is a novel regulator of hemangioblast differentiation to hematopoietic and endothelial cells.					9232	54345	79837	4772	3978	7075	2159	4023	10410	6521	2326	5720	3040	3836	22918	2395	79077	2623	2946	7389	1457	4201	54834	7122	10276	284119	3479	55845	373156	10661	92840	64116	126669	2038	388588	2022	285	1003	148534	55589	7035	255877	283120	4155	3396	5439	60	70	52	6648	51528	10266	8804	222068	23166	10040	10550	8328	2324	284996	22913	5469	6005	8728	4001

Mechanisms controlling the balance between proliferation and self-renewal versus growth suppression and differentiation during normal and leukemic myelopoiesis are not understood. We have used the bi-potent FDB1 myeloid cell line model, which is responsive to myelopoietic cytokines and activated mutants of the granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) receptor, having differential signaling and leukemogenic activity. This model is suited to large-scale gene-profiling, and we have used a factorial time-course design to generate a substantial and powerful data set. Linear modeling was used to identify gene-expression changes associated with continued proliferation, differentiation, or leukemic receptor signaling. We focused on the changing transcription factor profile, defined a set of novel genes with potential to regulate myeloid growth and differentiation, and demonstrated that the FDB1 cell line model is responsive to forced expression of oncogenes identified in this study. We also identified gene-expression changes associated specifically with the leukemic GM-CSF receptor mutant, V449E. Signaling from this receptor mutant down-regulates CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein alpha (C/EBPalpha) target genes and generates changes characteristic of a specific acute myeloid leukemia signature, defined previously by gene-expression profiling and associated with C/EBPalpha mutations.					2624	23560	9840	2530	4900	56245	1977	8490	9221	8204	94120	2529	6432	60496	7018	6747	4677	55608	811	6599	80896	79567	7294	124976	10954	160335	27334	4691	4436	10410	114915	6472	5874	3117	8600	2018	55617	2288	283248	3911	10653	51491	6659	22807	708	3119	9349	115024	4143	8614	1731	3123	1359	863	84916	1678	22894	10171	23160	55454	23450	4869	51251	10857	55183	962	1019	124540	3329	908	6566	366	23428	328	2149	56342	10204	274	1583	10856	2774	3122	11260	51602	6480	3416	6581	1015	5780	129642	10808	29968	6647	5091	4830	6510	4602	54888	10462	8645	10625	9002	4242	191	27346	4225	26031	94104	2158	4591	7982	64375	2205	10155	2618	10528	84172	8140	3150	79668	4953	54757	4249	58516	6468	9060	9289	28969	5470

Adenosine is released into the extracellular space from nerve terminals and cells subjected to ischemic stress. This nucleoside modulates a plethora of cellular functions via occupancy of specific receptors. Adenosine is also an important endogenous regulator of macrophage function, because it suppresses the production of a number of proinflammatory cytokines by these cells. However, the mechanisms of this anti-inflammatory effect have not been well characterized. We hypothesized that adenosine may exert some of its anti-inflammatory effects by decreasing activation of the transcription factor nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB), because gene expression of most of the proinflammatory cytokines inhibited by adenosine is dependent on NF-kappaB activation. Using bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated RAW 264.7 macrophages, we found that adenosine as well as adenosine receptor agonists decreased the production of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, a typical NF-kappaB-regulated cytokine. This effect of adenosine was not due to an action on the process of TNF-alpha release, because adenosine suppressed also the intracellular levels of TNF-alpha. However, cDNA microarray analysis revealed that mRNA levels of neither TNF-alpha nor other cytokines were altered by adenosine in either LPS-activated or quiescent macrophages. In addition, although LPS induced expression of a number of other, noncytokine genes, including the adenosine A2b receptor, adenosine did not affect the expression of these genes. Furthermore, adenosine as well as adenosine receptor agonists failed to decrease LPS-induced NF-kappaB DNA binding, NF-kappaB promoter activity, p65 nuclear translocation, and inhibitory kappaB degradation. Together, our results suggest that the anti-inflammatory effects of adenosine are independent of NF-kappaB.					7706	8878	7150	6348	8395	7133	3557	728	9592	2114	2745	8870	5604	1201	2182	255877	6513	4790	6590	10370	3839	8460	6303	4651	3156	7040	597	91663	5954	2107	5580	6648	3428	4050	100506736	837	4502	3475	5045	338339	8560	389	6556	65108	3055	4481	4792	3059	55106	8744	1052	960	9173	10962	9261	598	10209	4489	7296	1601	26994	2643	6890	3383	26118	103	10318	5552	1026	8837	5743	5610	6793	54518	719	2213	7124	6772	4860	2710	467	6574	3727	4953	8819	3937	6004	5371

Abdominal-type HoxA genes in combination with Meis1 are well-documented on-cogenes in various leukemias but it is unclear how they exert their transforming function. Here we used a system of conditional transformation by an inducible mixed lineage leukemia-eleven-nineteen leukemia (MLL-ENL) oncoprotein to overexpress Hoxa9 and Meis1 in primary hematopoietic cells. Arrays identified c-Myb and a c-Myb target (Gstm1) among the genes with the strongest response to Hoxa9/Meis1. c-Myb overexpression was verified by Northern blot and quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Also MLL-ENL activated c-Myb through up-regulation of Hoxa9 and Meis1. Consequently, short-term suppression of c-Myb by small inhibitory RNA (siRNA) efficiently inhibited transformation by MLL-ENL but did not impair transformation by transcription factor E2A-hepatic leukemia factor (E2A-HLF). The anti c-Myb siRNA effect was abrogated by coexpression of a c-Myb derivative with a mutated siRNA target site. The introduction of a dominant-negative c-Myb mutant had a similar but weaker effect on MLL-ENL-mediated transformation. Hematopoietic precursors from mice homozygous for a hypo-morphic c-Myb allele were more severely affected and could be transformed neither by MLL-ENL nor by E2A-HLF. Ectopic expression of c-Myb induced a differentiation block but c-Myb alone was not transforming in a replating assay similar to Hoxa9/Meis1. These results suggest that c-Myb is essential but not sufficient for Hoxa9/Meis1 mediated transformation.					51393	10748	5660	2867	4023	7538	10938	140885	7163	219972	307	7378	3398	50856	1843	25939	366	3055	4318	3006	2357	1959	10461	728	7018	2920	7850	4170	677	5341	6556	6809	2869	3988	1462	719	2268	4046	1514	1436	10397	999	4286	7832	64581	6275	3606	9516	4856	1958	2651	3553	1520	7097	22822	2353	1374	3934	4481	817	384	100506736	1234	91663	4360	762	9314	9934	2209	5359	1601	4317	301	7045	1536	29990	146722

Obesity is strongly correlated with type 2 diabetes mellitus, a common disorder of glucose and lipid metabolism. Although adipocytes are critical in obesity, their role in diabetes has only recently been appreciated. We conducted studies by using DNA microarrays to identify differences in gene expression in adipose tissue from lean, obese, and obese-diabetic mice. The expression level of over 11,000 transcripts was analyzed, and 214 transcripts showed significant differences between lean and obese mice. Surprisingly, the expression of genes normally associated with adipocyte differentiation were down-regulated in obesity. Not all obese individuals will become diabetic; many remain normoglycemic despite profound obesity. Understanding the transition to obesity with concomitant diabetes will provide important clues to the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes. Therefore, we examined the levels of gene expression in adipose tissue from five groups of obese mice with varying degrees of hyperglycemia, and we identified 88 genes whose expression strongly correlated with diabetes severity. This group included many genes that are known to be involved in signal transduction and energy metabolism as well as genes not previously examined in the context of diabetes. Our data show that a decrease in expression of genes normally involved in adipogenesis is associated with obesity, and we further identify genes important for subsequent development of type 2 diabetes mellitus.					1675	2326	5464	1915	5950	2820	3945	56922	47	7069	717	1652	1571	217	2222	1351	521	6720	2770	83549	4826	2167	2791	587	2632	51655	2940	4638	567	183	7385	7314	5939	5091	5834	6647	1622	1031	6390	1537	7253	155	440	5105	226	3240	348	1892

Meis1 is a homeodomain transcription factor coexpressed with Hoxa9 in most human acute myeloid leukemias (AMLs). In mouse models of leukemia produced by Hoxa9, Meis1 accelerates leukemogenesis. Because Hoxa9 immortalizes myeloid progenitors in the absence of Meis1 expression, the contribution of Meis1 toward leukemia remains unclear. Here, we describe a cultured progenitor model in which Meis1 programs leukemogenicity. Progenitors immortalized by Hoxa9 in culture are myeloid-lineage restricted and only infrequently caused leukemia after more than 250 days. Coexpressed Meis1 programmed rapid AML-initiating character, maintained multipotent progenitor potential, and induced expression of genes associated with short-term hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), such as FLT3 and CD34, whose expression also characterizes the leukemia-initiating stem cells of human AML. Meis1 leukemogenesis functions required binding to Pbx, binding to DNA, and a conserved function of its C-terminal tail. We hypothesize that Meis1 is required for the homing and survival of leukemic progenitors within their hematopoietic niches, functions mediated by HSC-specific genes such as CD34 and Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3), respectively. This is the first example of a transcription factor oncoprotein (Meis1) that establishes expression of a tyrosine kinase oncoprotein (FLT3), and explains their coexpression in human leukemia. This cultured progenitor model will be useful to define the genetic basis of leukemogenesis involving Hoxa9 and Meis1.					7049	4297	1438	932	57509	57381	4602	9331	1500	894	154664	26580	64581	8741	648	5657	6272	9615	79589	10261	22797	55106	1991	7057	57126	7099	211	4353	891	5138	3290

Adenosine is released into the extracellular space from nerve terminals and cells subjected to ischemic stress. This nucleoside modulates a plethora of cellular functions via occupancy of specific receptors. Adenosine is also an important endogenous regulator of macrophage function, because it suppresses the production of a number of proinflammatory cytokines by these cells. However, the mechanisms of this anti-inflammatory effect have not been well characterized. We hypothesized that adenosine may exert some of its anti-inflammatory effects by decreasing activation of the transcription factor nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB), because gene expression of most of the proinflammatory cytokines inhibited by adenosine is dependent on NF-kappaB activation. Using bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated RAW 264.7 macrophages, we found that adenosine as well as adenosine receptor agonists decreased the production of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, a typical NF-kappaB-regulated cytokine. This effect of adenosine was not due to an action on the process of TNF-alpha release, because adenosine suppressed also the intracellular levels of TNF-alpha. However, cDNA microarray analysis revealed that mRNA levels of neither TNF-alpha nor other cytokines were altered by adenosine in either LPS-activated or quiescent macrophages. In addition, although LPS induced expression of a number of other, noncytokine genes, including the adenosine A2b receptor, adenosine did not affect the expression of these genes. Furthermore, adenosine as well as adenosine receptor agonists failed to decrease LPS-induced NF-kappaB DNA binding, NF-kappaB promoter activity, p65 nuclear translocation, and inhibitory kappaB degradation. Together, our results suggest that the anti-inflammatory effects of adenosine are independent of NF-kappaB.					3005	34	4601	4066	6539	7903	55544	83593	1111	328	677	4288	3070	2969	8650	2237	899	6790	5997	6319	3676	8335	5001	64393	3113	7884	2353	22824	339	9619	4155	8543

Obesity is strongly correlated with type 2 diabetes mellitus, a common disorder of glucose and lipid metabolism. Although adipocytes are critical in obesity, their role in diabetes has only recently been appreciated. We conducted studies by using DNA microarrays to identify differences in gene expression in adipose tissue from lean, obese, and obese-diabetic mice. The expression level of over 11,000 transcripts was analyzed, and 214 transcripts showed significant differences between lean and obese mice. Surprisingly, the expression of genes normally associated with adipocyte differentiation were down-regulated in obesity. Not all obese individuals will become diabetic; many remain normoglycemic despite profound obesity. Understanding the transition to obesity with concomitant diabetes will provide important clues to the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes. Therefore, we examined the levels of gene expression in adipose tissue from five groups of obese mice with varying degrees of hyperglycemia, and we identified 88 genes whose expression strongly correlated with diabetes severity. This group included many genes that are known to be involved in signal transduction and energy metabolism as well as genes not previously examined in the context of diabetes. Our data show that a decrease in expression of genes normally involved in adipogenesis is associated with obesity, and we further identify genes important for subsequent development of type 2 diabetes mellitus.					10535	2297	83871	23609	5054	79174	10426	10575	5973	7409	155	5504	1857	3257	84916	2322	2213	3933	1212	2596	22800	10174	5153	6415	9528	8106	1349	54	28973	10923	2534	10477	5437	4709	1725	6628	871	10311	27229	4884	5292	10383	2965	1154	55806	1749	33	779	89781	1728	501	1939	571	26469	98	64425	7471	2980

The involvement of the c-Myc transcription factor in neoplastic transformation is well documented. However, which of its numerous target genes are crucial for tumorigenesis remains a frequently contested issue. We have recently established a non-transgenic murine model for B-cell lymphoma based on neoplastic conversion of p53-null bone marrow cells by conditionally active Myc. Using this model, we have identified a number of genes whose expression levels are affected by Myc during B-lymphomagenesis. Here we discuss their possible roles in neoplastic processes and describe an experimental approach allowing in vivo validation of these roles. We demonstrate that lymphoma cells overexpressing one of the Myc targets, the interleukin-10 receptor gene, have a very strong selective advantage over low IL10R expressors. Furthermore, Mcl1, a presumptive IL10R effector, also confers selective advantages when overexpressed in Myc-transformed hematopoietic cells. Thus, both IL10R and Mcl1 might be amenable to therapeutic interventions, and new targets can be identified and validated using the selection approach.					3109	10620	645638	51274	3117	640	1606	23499	2664	5863	7805	3108	26576	5579	57544	3587	81622	100506736	914	912	83606	9138	5896	2799	972	3119	115361	10439	2571	5937	694	3977	5837	951	5788	122618	3112	4257	931	23526	5871	6494	10365	8418	51466	19	54	4050	56605	4647	6689	8082	1512	23062	3123

The Janus kinase (Jak)-Stat pathway plays an essential role in cytokine signaling. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) promotes granulopoiesis and granulocytic differentiation, and Stat3 is the principle Stat protein activated by G-CSF. Upon treatment with G-CSF, the interleukin-3-dependent cell line 32D clone 3(32Dcl3) differentiates into neutrophils, and 32Dcl3 cells expressing dominant-negative Stat3 (32Dcl3/DNStat3) proliferate in G-CSF without differentiation. Gene expression profile and quantitative PCR analysis of G-CSF-stimulated cell lines revealed that the expression of C/EBPalpha was up-regulated by the activation of Stat3. In addition, activated Stat3 bound to CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP)alpha, leading to the enhancement of the transcription activity of C/EBPalpha. Conditional expression of C/EBPalpha in 32Dcl3/DNStat3 cells after G-CSF stimulation abolishes the G-CSF-dependent cell proliferation and induces granulocytic differentiation. Although granulocyte-specific genes, such as the G-CSF receptor, lysozyme M, and neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin precursor (NGAL) are regulated by Stat3, only NGAL was induced by the restoration of C/EBPalpha after stimulation with G-CSF in 32Dcl3/DNStat3 cells. These results show that one of the major roles of Stat3 in the G-CSF signaling pathway is to augment the function of C/EBPalpha, which is essential for myeloid differentiation. Additionally, cooperation of C/EBPalpha with other Stat3-activated proteins are required for the induction of some G-CSF responsive genes including lysozyme M and the G-CSF receptor.					5609	3359	861	6732	4814	3683	3046	596	4135	1050	9371	8174	898	6095	5783	4486	23765	8569	7037	29760	2313	2122

Chromosomal translocations that fuse the mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) gene with multiple partners typify acute leukemias of infancy as well as therapy-related leukemias. We utilized a conditional knockin strategy to bypass the embryonic lethality caused by MLL-CBP expression and to assess the immediate effects of induced MLL-CBP expression on hematopoiesis. Within days of activating MLL-CBP, the fusion protein selectively expanded granulocyte/macrophage progenitors (GMP) and enhanced their self-renewal/proliferation. MLL-CBP altered the gene expression program of GMP, upregulating a subset of genes including Hox a9. Inhibition of Hox a9 expression by RNA interference demonstrated that MLL-CBP required Hox a9 for its enhanced cell expansion. Following exposure to sublethal gamma-irradiation or N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU), MLL-CBP mice developed myelomonocytic hyperplasia and progressed to fatal myeloproliferative disorders. These represented the spectrum of therapy-induced acute myelomonocytic leukemia/chronic myelomonocytic leukemia/myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative disorder similar to that seen in humans possessing the t(11;16). This model of MLL-CBP therapy-related myeloproliferative disease demonstrates the selectivity of this MLL fusion for GMP cells and its ability to initiate leukemogenesis in conjunction with cooperating mutations.					1737	8260	57703	8508	8074	8829	10539	5705	847	894	80146	55622	10531	2171	3654	3035	117246	51068	8848	11186	7416	5480	23710	8451	84864	10972	51499	79073	23560	114294	1371	81704	11171	1522	6415	3837	9868	2539	8560	60626	154796	79080	79017	114876	501

Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) have self-renewal capacity and multilineage developmental potentials. The molecular mechanisms that control the self-renewal of HSCs are still largely unknown. Here, a systematic approach using bioinformatics and array hybridization techniques to analyze gene expression profiles in HSCs is described. To enrich mRNAs predominantly expressed in uncommitted cell lineages, 54 000 cDNA clones generated from a highly enriched population of HSCs and a mixed population of stem and early multipotent progenitor (MPP) cells were arrayed on nylon membranes (macroarray or high-density array), and subtracted with cDNA probes derived from mature lineage cells including spleen, thymus, and bone marrow. Five thousand cDNA clones with very low hybridization signals were selected for sequencing and further analysis using microarrays on glass slides. Two populations of cells, HSCs and MPP cells, were compared for differential gene expression using microarray analysis. HSCs have the ability to self-renew, while MPP cells have lost the capacity for self-renewal. A large number of genes that were differentially expressed by enriched populations of HSCs and MPP cells were identified. These included transcription factors, signaling molecules, and previously unknown genes.					10267	8992	10664	10174	7157	10169	8407	56647	3021	3837	7555	23157	10410	1032	5757	2665	6500	11064	2648	25792	7247	5030	7707	1432	84922	5478	9445	5690	332	27131	134553	6605	10266	4208	7716	675	22955	10791	51073	4061	388558	53344	6428	6047	4005	7267	4676	10694	3921	5449

The transcription factors encoded by the E2A gene have been shown to play essential roles in the initiation and progression of lymphocyte development. However, there is still a lack of comprehensive understanding of E2A downstream genes in B-cell development. We previously developed a gene tagging-based chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) system to directly evaluate E2A target genes in B-cell development. Here, we have improved this ChIP strategy and used it in conjunction with microarray analysis on E2A-deficient pre-B-cell lines to determine E2A target genes in lymphocyte development. Both microarray data and ChIP studies confirmed that E2A directly controls IgH gene expression. The microarray assay also revealed genes that were significantly up-regulated after E2A disruption. ChIP analysis showed that E2A was most likely to be directly involved in repression of some of these target genes such as Nfil3 and FGFR2. An inducible E2A reconstitution system further demonstrated that E2A-mediated repression of Nfil3 and FGFR2 was reversible. Collectively, these findings indicate that E2A is a positive regulator for one set of genes and a negative regulator for another set of genes in developing B lymphocytes.					64781	2549	10955	55303	640	972	2633	130814	249	51466	161145	9168	23741	100506736	4647	2760	2012	26999	51504	2547	27351

Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) mediates the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal stress response. Transgenic mice overexpressing LIF in the developing pituitary have altered pituitary differentiation with expansion of corticotropes, maintenance of Rathke's cleft cysts, and suppression of all other pituitary cell types. Affymetrix GeneChips were used to identify modulators of LIF effects in corticotrope (AtT-20) and somatolactotrope (GH(3)) cells. In addition to genes known to respond to LIF in corticotrope cells [e.g. suppressor of cytokine signaling-3 (SOCS-3), signal transducer and activator of transcription-3, SH2 domain-containing tyrosine phosphatase-1, and proopiomelanocortin (POMC)], corticotrope-specific changes were also observed for genes involved in glycolysis and gluconeogenesis, transcription factors, signaling molecules, and expressed sequence tags. Two transcription factors identified, CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein beta (C/EBPbeta) and glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF)-inducible factor (GIF), dose-dependently induced expression of the rat POMC promoter when overexpressed in AtT-20 cells. LIF further induced POMC transcription with C/EBPbeta, but not with GIF. C/EBPbeta also induced expression of the SOCS-3 promoter that was further enhanced by cotreatment with LIF. However, GIF did not affect SOCS-3 expression. These results indicate that C/EBPbeta and GIF are downstream effectors of LIF corticotrope action. LIF also stimulates the expression of inhibitors of its actions, such as SOCS-3 and SH2 domain-containing tyrosine phosphatase-1. alpha(2)-HS-glycoprotein (AHSG)/fetuin, a secreted protein that antagonizes bone TGFbeta/bone morphogenic protein signaling, was induced by LIF in a signal transducer and activator of transcription-3-dependent fashion. Pretreatment with AHSG/fetuin blocked LIF-induced expression of the POMC promoter independently of SOCS-3. Thus, using GeneChips, C/EBPbeta and GIF have been identified as novel mediators and AHSG/fetuin as an inhibitor of LIF action in corticotropes.					1999	6037	1051	3659	3554	7378	3036	9111	3934	6774	7071	5999	28959	5443	58472	58480	2266	9021	22821	65983	5696	2878	6343	602	4121	9547	116844	1534	197	230	7132	244	7494	3827	6892	5770	55365	10449	7106	56261	4353	6482	2203	3929	5337	7450

CCAAT/enhancer-binding proteins (C/EBPs) are a family of transcription factors that regulate cell growth and differentiation in numerous cell types. To identify novel C/EBP-target genes, we performed transcriptional profiling using inducible NIH 3T3 cell lines expressing 1 of 4 members of the C/EBP family. Functional analysis revealed a previously unknown link between C/EBP proteins and circadian clock genes. Our microarray data showed that the expression levels of 2 core components of the circadian network, Per2 and Rev-Erbalpha, were significantly altered by C/EBPs. Recent studies suggested that Per2 behaves as a tumor suppressor gene in mice. Therefore, we focused our additional studies on Per2. We showed that Per2 expression is up-regulated by C/EBPalpha and C/EBPepsilon. Per2 levels were reduced in lymphoma cell lines and in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patient samples. In addition, we generated stable K562 cells that expressed an inducible Per2 gene. Induction of Per2 expression resulted in growth inhibition, cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, and loss of clonogenic ability. These results suggest that Per2 is a downstream C/EBPalpha-target gene involved in AML, and its disruption might be involved in initiation and/or progression of AML.					79071	26973	6274	7832	718	51706	65997	1462	2745	4047	4616	51129	3399	2765	2643	3827	594	54810	8829	968	7498	65981	10912	1649	2295	10808	912	1687	3304	2252	2290	2872	4189	1839	2180	961	1843	2717	3481	23645	10544	59	204851	7975	2069	54518	8347	6050	57761	2274	1892	2353	3934	6457	126961	3300	23286	9592	56261	5292	3240	3337	8968	1382	3156	4597	6004	10458	5468	9314	51109	5055	8864	5327	1191	138050	6236	9531	5004	1628	50814	64388	467	3428	225	5621	7037	4023	2919	19	4803	10553	3303	6745	84173	90637	1634	55076	10631	288	116150	645638	6279	3082	100506736	3726	3398	51099	11249	5329	10040	7053	3162	5806	8682	122622	9926	1410	5274	3475	6372	7130	5997	218	6303	9572

Constitutive ablation of the Yin Yang 1 (YY1) transcription factor in mice results in peri-implantation lethality. In this study, we used homologous recombination to generate knockout mice carrying yy1 alleles expressing various amounts of YY1. Phenotypic analysis of yy1 mutant embryos expressing approximately 75%, approximately 50%, and approximately 25% of the normal complement of YY1 identified a dosage-dependent requirement for YY1 during late embryogenesis. Indeed, reduction of YY1 levels impairs embryonic growth and viability in a dose-dependent manner. Analysis of the corresponding mouse embryonic fibroblast cells also revealed a tight correlation between YY1 dosage and cell proliferation, with a complete ablation of YY1 inducing cytokinesis failure and cell cycle arrest.

Constitutive ablation of the Yin Yang 1 (YY1) transcription factor in mice results in peri-implantation lethality. In this study, we used homologous recombination to generate knockout mice carrying yy1 alleles expressing various amounts of YY1. Phenotypic analysis of yy1 mutant embryos expressing approximately 75%, approximately 50%, and approximately 25% of the normal complement of YY1 identified a dosage-dependent requirement for YY1 during late embryogenesis. Indeed, reduction of YY1 levels impairs embryonic growth and viability in a dose-dependent manner. Analysis of the corresponding mouse embryonic fibroblast cells also revealed a tight correlation between YY1 dosage and cell proliferation, with a complete ablation of YY1 inducing cytokinesis failure and cell cycle arrest. Consistently, RNA interference-mediated inhibition of YY1 in HeLa cells prevents cytokinesis, causes proliferative arrest, and increases cellular sensitivity to various apoptotic agents. Genome-wide expression profiling identified a plethora of YY1 target genes that have been implicated in cell growth, proliferation, cytokinesis, apoptosis, development, and differentiation, suggesting that YY1 coordinates multiple essential biological processes through a complex transcriptional network.

Abdominal-type HoxA genes in combination with Meis1 are well-documented on-cogenes in various leukemias but it is unclear how they exert their transforming function. Here we used a system of conditional transformation by an inducible mixed lineage leukemia-eleven-nineteen leukemia (MLL-ENL) oncoprotein to overexpress Hoxa9 and Meis1 in primary hematopoietic cells. Arrays identified c-Myb and a c-Myb target (Gstm1) among the genes with the strongest response to Hoxa9/Meis1. c-Myb overexpression was verified by Northern blot and quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Also MLL-ENL activated c-Myb through up-regulation of Hoxa9 and Meis1. Consequently, short-term suppression of c-Myb by small inhibitory RNA (siRNA) efficiently inhibited transformation by MLL-ENL but did not impair transformation by transcription factor E2A-hepatic leukemia factor (E2A-HLF). The anti c-Myb siRNA effect was abrogated by coexpression of a c-Myb derivative with a mutated siRNA target site. The introduction of a dominant-negative c-Myb mutant had a similar but weaker effect on MLL-ENL-mediated transformation. Hematopoietic precursors from mice homozygous for a hypo-morphic c-Myb allele were more severely affected and could be transformed neither by MLL-ENL nor by E2A-HLF. Ectopic expression of c-Myb induced a differentiation block but c-Myb alone was not transforming in a replating assay similar to Hoxa9/Meis1. These results suggest that c-Myb is essential but not sufficient for Hoxa9/Meis1 mediated transformation.					79727	8531	3205	3416	6627	4925	7465	7158	4172	3384	23212	57381	54984	1841	687	637	8888	9319	940	65010	4691	3156	56667	2171	3276	2944	8607	24146	9274	1050	4436	7866	10989	4602	29128	5150	586	1854	10856	4176	7023	9583	3066	56342	2805	10988	4605	4953	6240	440	8318	174	4638	4734	10282	708	2553	29088	7263	9221	4534	1503	27037	9093	51602

Human infertility and recurrent pregnancy loss caused by implantation defects are poorly understood. Hoxa-10-deficient female mice have severe infertility and recurrent pregnancy loss due to defective uterine implantation. Gene expression profiling experiments reveal that Hoxa-10 is an important regulator of two critical events in implantation: stromal cell proliferation and local immunosuppression. At the time of implantation, Hoxa-10 mediates the progesterone-stimulated proliferation of uterine stromal cells. Hoxa-10 mutants express a stromal cell proliferation defect that is accompanied by quantitative or spatial alterations in the expression of two cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor genes, p57 and p15. Hoxa-10 deficiency also leads to a severe local immunological disturbance, characterized by a polyclonal proliferation of T cells, that occurs in place of the normal progesterone-mediated immunosuppression in the periimplantation uterus.					2335	1829	3206	58	8854	221883	10468	1030	58476	5121	2697	1306	3207	7532	249	26	5768	7049	5284

Unfolded and malfolded client proteins impose a stress on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), which contributes to cell death in pathophysiological conditions. The transcription factor C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) is activated by ER stress, and CHOP deletion protects against its lethal consequences. We find that CHOP directly activates GADD34, which promotes ER client protein biosynthesis by dephosphorylating phospho-Ser 51 of the alpha-subunit of translation initiation factor 2 (eIF2alpha) in stressed cells. Thus, impaired GADD34 expression reduces client protein load and ER stress in CHOP(-/-) cells exposed to perturbations that impair ER function. CHOP(-/-) and GADD34 mutant cells accumulate less high molecular weight protein complexes in their stressed ER than wild-type cells. Furthermore, mice lacking GADD34-directed eIF2alpha dephosphorylation, like CHOP(-/-) mice, are resistant to renal toxicity of the ER stress-inducing drug tunicamycin. CHOP also activates ERO1alpha, which encodes an ER oxidase. Consequently, the ER of stressed CHOP(-/-) cells is relatively hypo-oxidizing. Pharmacological and genetic manipulations that promote a hypo-oxidizing ER reduce abnormal high molecular weight protein complexes in the stressed ER and protect from the lethal consequences of ER stress. CHOP deletion thus protects cells from ER stress by decreasing ER client protein load and changing redox conditions within the organelle.					4254	8987	1182	4534	8435	9361	25885	2114	55544	51651	272	5806	7866	30001	50855	7466	131	765	6917	1649	83879	1119	56342	5810	23645

Although the mature neutrophil is one of the better characterized mammalian cell types, the mechanisms of myeloid differentiation are incompletely understood at the molecular level. A mouse promyelocytic cell line (MPRO), derived from murine bone marrow cells and arrested developmentally by a dominant-negative retinoic acid receptor, morphologically differentiates to mature neutrophils in the presence of 10 microM retinoic acid. An extensive catalog was prepared of the gene expression changes that occur during morphologic maturation. To do this, 3'-end differential display, oligonucleotide chip array hybridization, and 2-dimensional protein electrophoresis were used. A large number of genes whose mRNA levels are modulated during differentiation of MPRO cells were identified. The results suggest the involvement of several transcription regulatory factors not previously implicated in this process, but they also emphasize the importance of events other than the production of new transcription factors. Furthermore, gene expression patterns were compared at the level of mRNA and protein, and the correlation between 2 parameters was studied.

With the goal of creating a resource for in-depth study of myelopoiesis, we have executed a 2-pronged strategy to obtain a complementary DNA (cDNA) clone set enriched in hematopoietic genes. One aspect is a library subtraction to enrich for underrepresented transcripts present at early stages of hematopoiesis. For this, a hematopoietic cDNA library from primary murine bone marrow cells enriched for primitive progenitors was used as tester. The subtraction used 10 000 known genes and expressed sequence tags (ESTs) as driver. The 2304 randomly picked clones from the subtracted cDNA libraries represent 1255 distinct genes, of which 622 (50%) are named genes, 386 (30%) match uncharacterized ESTs, and 247 (20%) are novel. The second aspect of our strategy was to complement this subtracted library with genes known to be involved in myeloid cell differentiation and function. The resulting cDNAs were arrayed on polylysine-coated glass slides. The microarrays were used to analyze gene expression in primary and cultured murine bone marrow-derived progenitors. We found expression of various types of genes, including regulatory cytokines and their receptors, signal transduction genes, and transcription factors. To assess gene expression during myeloid differentiation, we examined patterns of change during induced differentiation of EML cells. Several hundred of the genes underwent fluctuations in expression level during myeloid cell differentiation. The complete database, accessible on the World Wide Web at http://yale130132115135.med.yale.edu/, allows for retrieval of information regarding these genes. Our microarray allows for genomewide expression analysis of myeloid stem cells, which will help in defining the regulatory mechanisms of stem cell differentiation.					665	5478	51621	3002	100	5496	22823	687	3512	4641	2014	3615	8804	1026	3695	5781	1725	811	7314	1603	712	4489	5925	22948	2264	7073	5901	4193	4090	5863	1915	2778	4691	10044	5553	9113	1995	6363	7408

These results suggest that E2F1/E2F2 activity negatively controls growth of mature pancreatic cells and is necessary for the maintenance of differentiated pancreatic phenotypes in the adult.					23191	1195	1634	33	23452	2782	291	963	3301	5947	2012	5111	115361	6760	7280	6277	4000	761	27020	1292	1510	8726	3181	80781	55076	1282	3487	1290	3688	203068	6678	713	51466	7305	1036	714	4060	998	22795	1278	1293	1522	10563	5311	830	4066	4811	212	301	302	410	718	1277	1266	334	1163	947	23705	7857	80739	2771	989	3398	2934	3936	128	805	9689	10491	5168	9445	1003	4174	712	27101	4254	1306	59	4792	1028	4086	9452	567	4176	4360	34	4616	1601	9741	10631	894	1465	306	4735	3910	7763	4781	2621	3987	7114	11034	1281	4023	7805	3880	10376	900	388	871	10551	11154	961	5176	6319	6281	3040	1396	10010	6303	6284	4237	29928	5269	3956	348	10592	4172	9370	71	7057	3320	972	928	3488	990	2326	581	7846	6500	5931	5376	6282	1675	2006	2697	55122	1520	2199	10933	4969	7358
KAMMINGA_EZH2_TARGETS	M1486		16293602	Kamminga LM,Bystrykh LV,de Boer A,Houwer S,Douma J,Weersing E,Dontje B,de Haan G		Table 1			MOUSE_GENE_SYMBOL	Kevin Vogelsang	Broad Institute	Putative targets or partners of EZH2 [GeneID=2146] in hematopoietic stem cells.	The molecular mechanism responsible for a decline of stem cell functioning after replicative stress remains unknown. We used mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) to identify genes involved in the process of cellular aging. In proliferating and senescent MEFs one of the most differentially expressed transcripts was Enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (Ezh2), a Polycomb group protein (PcG) involved in histone methylation and deacetylation. Retroviral overexpression of Ezh2 in MEFs resulted in bypassing of the senescence program. More importantly, whereas normal HSCs were rapidly exhausted after serial transplantations, overexpression of Ezh2 completely conserved long-term repopulating potential. Animals that were reconstituted with 3 times serially transplanted control bone marrow cells all died due to hematopoietic failure. In contrast, similarly transplanted Ezh2-overexpressing stem cells restored stem cell quality to normal levels. In a genetic genomics screen, we identified novel putative Ezh2 target or partner stem cell genes that are associated with chromatin modification. Our data suggest that stabilization of the chromatin structure preserves HSC potential after replicative stress.					8520	4288	7514	10460	191	4172	8726	51053	4173	6240	7153	5501	1894	4673	5557	10926	4171	4085	1791	9055	5981	3015	3843	9212	5933	4751	11073	6119	5427	83879	7027	3838	51203	5111	10592	9133	10051	6790	9869	113130	8453
HANSON_HRAS_SIGNALING_VIA_NFKB	M1488		15492243	Hanson JL,Hawke NA,Kashatus D,Baldwin AS		Table 1			SEQ_ACCESSION	Kevin Vogelsang	Broad Institute	Genes changed by expression of activated form of HRas[GeneID=3265] in MEF cells (embryonic fibroblast) with or without p65/c-Rel complex [GeneID=5970;5966].	Extensive data indicate that oncoproteins, such as oncogenic H-Ras, initiate signal transduction cascades that ultimately lead to the activation of specific transcription factors. We and others have previously demonstrated that Ras activates the inherent transcriptional activation function of the transcription factor nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB). Supportive of the importance of NF-kappaB in transformation, Ras-induced cellular transformation can be suppressed by expression of IkappaBalpha, an inhibitor of NF-kappaB, or by dominant-negative forms of the upstream activator IkappaB kinase (IKK). However, conclusive evidence for a requirement for NF-kappaB subunits in oncogenic transformation has not been reported. Furthermore, there is little understanding of the gene targets controlled by NF-kappaB that might support oncogenic conversion. The data presented here demonstrate that, although both p65 and c-Rel enhance the frequency of Ras-induced cellular transformation, these NF-kappaB subunits are not essential for Ras to transform spontaneously immortalized murine fibroblasts. Microarray analysis identified a set of genes induced by Ras that is dependent on NF-kappaB for their expression and that likely play contributory roles in promoting Ras-induced oncogenic transformation.					6660	10321	80781	8394	10669	51274	387763	4879	5317	5055	152	6404	3963	5817	85480	220	23529	29767	150	127544	57630	6793

The transcription factors encoded by the E2A gene have been shown to play essential roles in the initiation and progression of lymphocyte development. However, there is still a lack of comprehensive understanding of E2A downstream genes in B-cell development. We previously developed a gene tagging-based chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) system to directly evaluate E2A target genes in B-cell development. Here, we have improved this ChIP strategy and used it in conjunction with microarray analysis on E2A-deficient pre-B-cell lines to determine E2A target genes in lymphocyte development. Both microarray data and ChIP studies confirmed that E2A directly controls IgH gene expression. The microarray assay also revealed genes that were significantly up-regulated after E2A disruption. ChIP analysis showed that E2A was most likely to be directly involved in repression of some of these target genes such as Nfil3 and FGFR2. An inducible E2A reconstitution system further demonstrated that E2A-mediated repression of Nfil3 and FGFR2 was reversible. Collectively, these findings indicate that E2A is a positive regulator for one set of genes and a negative regulator for another set of genes in developing B lymphocytes.					57650	760	6558	54443	699	7272	29127	51203	9957	4085	6790	3832	890	10733	1031	2058	891	23588	4288	5742	85477	5230	1894	24137	1978	2263	51186	7153	7298	3014	11004	8140	9133

The molecular mechanisms governing self-renewal, differentiation, and lineage specification remain unknown. Transcriptional profiling is likely to provide insight into these processes but, as yet, has been confined to static molecular profiles of stem and progenitors cells. We now provide a comprehensive, statistically robust, and dynamic analysis of multipotent hemopoietic progenitor cells undergoing self-renewal in response to interleukin-3 (IL-3) and multilineage differentiation in response to lineage-affiliated cytokines. Cells undergoing IL-3-dependent proliferative self-renewal displayed striking complexity, including expression of genes associated with different lineage programs, suggesting a highly responsive compartment poised to rapidly execute intrinsically or extrinsically initiated cell fate decisions. A remarkable general feature of early differentiation was a resolution of complexity through the downregulation of gene expression. Although effector genes characteristic of mature cells were upregulated late, coincident with morphological changes, lineage-specific changes in gene expression were observed prior to this, identifying genes which may provide early harbingers of unilineage commitment. Of particular interest were genes that displayed differential behavior irrespective of the lineage elaborated, many of which were rapidly downregulated within 4 to 8 h after exposure to a differentiation cue. These are likely to include genes important in self-renewal, the maintenance of multipotentiality, or the negative regulation of differentiation per se.					10791	1997	10276	5954	25897	8347	3565	10321	85021	4856	6480	7006	1605	27244	901	2584	1717	55740	1075	2720	5214	2280	64397	6277	4214	928	3028	2015	366	8878	7075	7462	5934	726	100506736	79071	10397	5176	25800	7082	3099	8773	963	1363	10549	3156	6307	8553	2248	1604	5087	3490	203	25819	6678	10077	796	5739	596	3005	302	6692	6348	664	5743	6319
KUMAR_TARGETS_OF_MLL_AF9_FUSION	M3284		14615372	Kumar AR,Hudson WA,Chen W,Nishiuchi R,Yao Q,Kersey JH		Table 1S			MG_U74Av2	Kevin Vogelsang	Broad Institute	Myeloid leukemia model in mice with germ-line MLL-AF9 fusion knock-in [GeneID=4297;4300]: genes changed in comparison among the leukemic, preleukemic and wild-type animals.	Identification of the targets of mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) fusion genes will assist in understanding the biology of MLL fusion gene leukemias and in development of better therapies. Numerous studies have implicated HOXA9 as one of the possible targets of MLL fusion proteins. To determine if HOXA9 was required for leukemia development by MLL fusion genes, we compared the effects of the Mll-AF9 knock-in mutation in mice in the presence or absence of Hoxa9. Both groups of mice showed myeloid expansion at 8 weeks and then developed myeloid leukemia with a similar incidence and time course. The leukemia in the mice lacking Hoxa9 generally displayed a more immature myeloid phenotype than that in the mice that were wild-type for Hoxa9. Gene expression profiling revealed that expression of Mll-AF9 led to overexpression of Hoxa5, Hoxa6, Hoxa7, Hoxa9, and Hoxa10. Thus, genes of the Hox-a cluster are important in defining the phenotype but not the incidence of Mll-AF9 leukemia. These results demonstrate that the Mll-AF9 fusion gene disrupts the expression of several Hox genes, none of which as a single gene is likely to be necessary for development of leukemia. Instead, we propose that the Hox code minimally defined by the Hoxa5-a9 cluster is central to MLL leukemogenesis.					8022	92140	730249	23597	5358	6199	3248	9420	3206	55103	3434	58526	2139	11040	55970	27090	923	3932	51329	349633	79575	6608	29919	25864	26750	931	9014	55593	10424	84172	79716	2990	3646	22936	79683	29965	481	85014	4635	5930	593	2550	5578	53407	374882	5321	7015	715	2591	83877	79887	1832	5727	4050	5611	11274	5450	2203	23401	10631	23466	1933	4211	23580	27347	922	84681	284307	55565	901	55303	3702	92675	2137	5179	92703	301	5715	3204	4318	2132	9076	64859	10370	23380	3428	3433	28954	2239	255231	55034	10501	1760	2939	401152	51564	2707	1182	2209	85364	487	384	27434	10153	89796	57157	6659	11328	2205	10267	11107	3959	9618	348035	3983	55850	29851	780	3579	54982	222487	1791	92014	129607	3662	65981	50626	1003	3624	58476	1158	7535	7412	221178	400916	4953	9437	5734	5595	643	26994	84824	10409	1359	5096	4099	51108	10391	11030	4784	3821	3437	8263	8288	2534	5094	930	57713	23564	3575	3205	64928	6932	94103	1534	3938	84895	1633	406	2159	3308	340784	6916	5163	10016	25814	939	5150	6689	9124	2597	64216	5896	928	5236	3181	65983	55275	1823	8522	10509	3257	79676	8502	10439	8787	7441	245	91543	54928	5191	817	9957	2833	51100	926	6385	388	401612	5214	11156	83606	921	8549	57228	90231	2151	123787	3665	114915	6480	3417	10898	64077	3824	4208	2625	971	55754	914	3202	6304	134147	3005	3382	35	2734	7378	2219	1687	10394	54676	2583	23042	5588	2620	55608	51176	55504	1452	7782	645638	79888	7320	5925	4642	6450	9452	4082	121599	1521	7514	11168	3507	9308	5790	29789	84817	4154	8514	3097	4074	7070	7295	246	284	640	1508	55341	10533	29785	5480	170575	27141	55699	2028	83706	8320	670	6261	1317	27240	10057	23070	1879	973	7358	207	472	3557	6696	9446	2149	7941	401397	51523	27072	366	51534	64065	3140	79153	2623	8581	5906	27333	59345	60481	3565	103	56961	5553	23481	1737	153090	4360	9823	5876	158219	925	6453	3001	4297	29760	51571	2006	4780	1339	6319	10803	2208	51617	80108	83982	9636	55182	27075	54558	5604	161882	2981	81691	10379	6352	122060	8434	80169	641638	4057	2194	2817	10270	3067	55350	3157	5371	9924	149076	1075	58503	60436	1852	3543	714	143684	4256	4669	3479	9517	1901	3203	7167	3099	8669	256949	501	3987	29802	9173	2878	3456	2206	1583	2052	256586	1604	56905	23623	6558	483	5079	1310	387893	11031	916

Mechanisms regulating self-renewal and cell fate decisions in mammalian stem cells are poorly understood. We determined global gene expression profiles for mouse and human hematopoietic stem cells and other stages of the hematopoietic hierarchy. Murine and human hematopoietic stem cells share a number of expressed gene products, which define key conserved regulatory pathways in this developmental system. Moreover, in the mouse, a portion of the genetic program of hematopoietic stem cells is shared with embryonic and neural stem cells.

LEE_AGING_NEOCORTEX_DN	M1497		10888876	Lee CK,Weindruch R,Prolla TA		Table 2S			SEQ_ACCESSION	John Newman	University of Washington	Downregulated in the neocortex of aged adult mice (30-month) vs young adult (5-month)	Ageing of the brain leads to impairments in cognitive and motor skills, and is the major risk factor for several common neurological disorders such as Alzheimer disease (AD) and Parkinson disease (PD). Recent studies suggest that normal brain ageing is associated with subtle morphological and functional alterations in specific neuronal circuits, as opposed to large-scale neuronal loss. In fact, ageing of the central nervous system in diverse mammalian species shares many features, such as atrophy of pyramidal neurons, synaptic atrophy, decrease of striatal dopamine receptors, accumulation of fluorescent pigments, cytoskeletal abnormalities, and reactive astrocytes and microglia. To provide the first global analysis of brain ageing at the molecular level, we used oligonucleotide arrays representing 6,347 genes to determine the gene-expression profile of the ageing neocortex and cerebellum in mice. Ageing resulted in a gene-expression profile indicative of an inflammatory response, oxidative stress and reduced neurotrophic support in both brain regions. At the transcriptional level, brain ageing in mice displays parallels with human neurodegenerative disorders. Caloric restriction, which retards the ageing process in mammals, selectively attenuated the age-associated induction of genes encoding inflammatory and stress responses.					11185	4828	3054	2668	2475	2737	51720	1356	4738	390010	23001	51231	6993	132625	7353	468	4354	3065	390992	5068	5893	7025	2878	3108	523	5648	5801	29895	1291	51347	3360	5979	2256	55342	4050	7529	1893	462	124925	8886	150	656	84669	2318	5695	991	2641	3221	350	10914	6885	3145	1158	4063	434	9315	1937	5591	4543	10107	5607	3312	3201	1478	8869	5582	4886	70	23660	1628	4635	58158	6967	10116	2935	9757	1104	2947	2171	6346
MCCLUNG_DELTA_FOSB_TARGETS_8WK	M17173		14566342	McClung CA,Nestler EJ		Table 6S			MG_U74Av2	John Newman	University of Washington	Genes up-regulated in the nucleus accumbens (a major reward center in brain) 8 weeks after induction of deltaFosB, a FOSB [GeneID=2354] splice variant.	DeltaFosB (a truncated form of FosB) and CREB (cAMP response element binding protein) are transcription factors induced in the brain's reward pathways after chronic exposure to drugs of abuse. However, their mechanisms of action and the genes they regulate remain unclear. Using microarray analysis in the nucleus accumbens of inducible transgenic mice, we found that CREB and a dominant-negative CREB have opposite effects on gene expression, as do prolonged expression of DeltaFosB and the activator protein-1 (AP-1) antagonist DeltacJun. However, unlike CREB, short-term and prolonged DeltaFosB induction had opposing effects on gene expression. Gene expression induced by short-term DeltaFosB and by CREB was strikingly similar, and both reduced the rewarding effects of cocaine, whereas prolonged DeltaFosB expression increased drug reward. Gene expression after a short cocaine treatment was more dependent on CREB, whereas gene expression after a longer cocaine treatment became increasingly DeltaFosB dependent. These findings help define the molecular functions of CREB and DeltaFosB and identify clusters of genes that contribute to cocaine addiction.					135	3340	292	7917	1183	2902	5660	9099	2572	117	377	815	57680	6747	3745	808	4779	1408	10608	52	25822	4628	127933	3423	103	2891	9145	9770	58526	3756	1000	10098	23095	9181	3798	2775	148281	54928	22913	9915	55920	610	27125	1128	30815	5579	10097

DNA microarrays are powerful tools for the analysis of gene expression on a genomic scale. The importance of individual regulatory events for the process under study can however not be deduced unequivocally without additional experiments. We devised a strategy to identify central regulators of cancer drug responses by combining the results of microarray experiments with efficient methods for phenotypic testing of candidate genes. We exposed murine FL5.12 pro-B cells to cisplatin, camptothecin, methotrexate or paclitaxel, respectively and analysed the patterns of gene expression with cDNA microarrays. Drug-specific regulatory events as well as intersections between different apoptotic pathways, including previously studied responses to staurosporine and interleukin-3 (IL-3) deprivation, were identified. Genes shared by at least three pathways were chosen for further analysis. Ectopic expression of three such genes, TEAP, GP49B, and Lipin1 was found to have an anti-proliferative effect on pro-B cells. Interestingly, we identified hemoglobin alpha as a strong pro-apoptotic regulator. While hemoglobin-expressing cells were growing normally in the presence of IL-3, they displayed accelerated apoptosis with similar kinetics as Bax overexpressing cells upon IL-3 removal. The pro-apoptotic effect of hemoglobin was suppressed by Bcl-2 and was characterized by enhanced stimulation of caspase activity.					205	2287	79585	84034	3157	5478	307	6576	2821	25994	4253	10410	3925	51501	596	5165	4731	2027	6776	10581	2597	665	26578	4493	54440	226	2023

We have analyzed the developmental molecular programs of the mouse hippocampus, a cortical structure critical for learning and memory, by means of large-scale DNA microarray techniques. Of 11,000 genes and expressed sequence tags examined, 1,926 showed dynamic changes during hippocampal development from embryonic day 16 to postnatal day 30. Gene-cluster analysis was used to group these genes into 16 distinct clusters with striking patterns that appear to correlate with major developmental hallmarks and cellular events. These include genes involved in neuronal proliferation, differentiation, and synapse formation. A complete list of the transcriptional changes has been compiled into a comprehensive gene profile database (http://BrainGenomics.Princeton.edu), which should prove valuable in advancing our understanding of the molecular and genetic programs underlying both the development and the functions of the mammalian brain.					2710	488	5579	2907	226	6857	2891	6663	627	6855	527	1351	23410	8775	8525	9588	885	3265	5315	115557	9049	4720	5530	4190	1212	7416	5837	274	2185	6262	2819	5864	55294	4900	3778	4884	2023	529	6812	7301	2821	1958	6456	537	322	5923	3508	6844	6389	23620	477	2026	2890	1917	388	5595	6376	526	3945	7167	528	4708	7881
BURTON_ADIPOGENESIS_10	M1500		15033539	Burton GR,Nagarajan R,Peterson CA,McGehee RE Jr		Table 2: cluster 4			SEQ_ACCESSION	John Newman	University of Washington	Strongly down-regulated at 8-48 h during differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells (fibroblast) into adipocytes.	During cellular differentiation and development, it is recognized that many complex molecular mechanisms as well as precise patterns of differentially expressed genes occur in directing precursor cells toward a given lineage. Using microarray-based technology, we examined gene expression across the course of 3T3-L1 adipocyte differentiation. Total cellular RNA was isolated at times 0, 2, 8, 16, 24, 48, and 96 h following treatment with either standard hormonal inducers of differentiation; insulin, dexamethasone, isobutylmethylxanthine (IDX), or IDX plus trichostatin A (TsA), a histone deacetylase inhibitor and potent adipogenic inhibitor. cRNA was synthesized from cellular RNA and hybridized to high density Affymetrix MG_U74Av2 microarray gene chips containing 12,488 cDNA/Expressed Sequence Tags (ESTs) probe sets. From the IDX-only treated cells, all probe sets that were either unchanged or differentially expressed less than 2-fold throughout differentiation with respect to time 0 preadipocytes were excluded from further analyses. This selection resulted in a net of 1686 transcripts, 859 were increased in expression, and 827 were decreased in expression at least 2-fold across differentiation. To focus in on genes that were more specific to differentiation, the same analysis was performed on IDX plus TsA-treated non-differentiating cells and all probe sets from the IDX-only group that exhibited similar expression profiles in the non-differentiating TsA-treated group were excluded leaving a total of 1016 transcripts that were regulated only under differentiating conditions. Six hundred and thirty-six of these transcripts were elevated at least 2-fold and 380 exhibited a decrease in expression relative to time 0 preadipocytes. This group of genes was further analyzed using hierarchical clustering and self-organizing maps and resulted in the identification of numerous genes not previously known to be regulated during adipocyte differentiation. Many of these genes may well represent novel adipogenic mediators and markers of adipogenesis.					65124	51406	4534	5866	3157	309	2224	132864	140738	10211	4154	83641	9208	6713	55342	151011	23348	8436	5834	7414	528	2222	901	9039	50814	2992	33	4023	6307	54469

Malignant transformation of mouse skin by chemical carcinogens and tumour promoters, such as the phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), is a multistage process that leads to squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) formation. In an effort to identify tumour-associated genes, we studied the influence of short-term TPA-treatment on the gene expression profile of murine skin. A comprehensive microarray with some 5,000 murine gene specific cDNA fragments was established and hybridised with pooled RNA derived from control and TPA-treated dorsal skin samples. Of these genes, 54 were up- and 35 were down-regulated upon TPA application. Additionally, we performed suppression subtractive hybridisation (SSH) with respective RNA pools to generate and analyse a cDNA library enriched for TPA-inducible genes. Expression data of selected genes were confirmed by quantitative real-time PCR and Northern blot analysis. Comparison of microarray and SSH data revealed that 26% of up-regulated genes identified by expression profiling matched with those present in the SSH library. Besides numerous known genes, we identified a large set of unknown cDNAs that represent previously unrecognised TPA-regulated genes in murine skin with potential function in tumour promotion. Additionally, some TPA-induced genes, such as Sprr1A, Saa3, JunB, Il4ralpha, Gp38, RalGDS and Slpi exhibit high basal level in advanced stages of skin carcinogenesis, suggesting that at least a subgroup of the identified TPA-regulated genes may contribute to tumour progression and metastasis.					51297	6700	5900	145942	10180	6280	6236	4830	5937	103	1515	6698	140901	309	4502	10488	4953	23246	3566	6279	55829	51340	51691	6096	3726	64859	10630	8721	51095	8784	79887	26231	5725	9920	6288	6723	7356	285231	6590	2643	4144	4489
RUAN_RESPONSE_TO_TROGLITAZONE_UP	M1504		12732648	Ruan H,Pownall HJ,Lodish HF		Table 1: Fold-TGZ >= 1.1			SEQ_ACCESSION	John Newman	University of Washington	Adipocyte abundant genes up-regulated in 3T3-L1 cells (fibroblasts induced to differentiate to adipocytes) in response to troglitazone [PubChem=5591].	Troglitazone (TGZ), a member of the thiazolidinedione class of anti-diabetic compounds and a peroxisome proliferator activator receptor-gamma (PPAR-gamma) agonist, restores systemic insulin sensitivity and improves the full insulin resistance syndrome in vivo. The mechanisms underlying its in vivo function are not understood. Here we investigated the potential functional interaction between PPAR-gamma and NF-kappaB in adipocytes. We show that TGZ selectively blocked tumor necrosis factor-alpha-induced and NF-kappaB-dependent repression of multiple adipocyte-specific genes and induction of growth phase and other genes. This occurs without interfering with NF-kappaB expression, activation, nuclear translocation, or DNA binding and without suppressing NF-kappaB-dependent survival signals. Notably, the expressions of some tumor necrosis factor-alpha-induced genes in adipocytes were unaffected by PPAR-gamma activation. In reporter gene assays in HeLa cells, ectopic expression of PPAR-gamma abolished induction of a NF-kappaB-responsive reporter gene by the p65 subunit (RelA) of NF-kappaB, and the inhibition was further enhanced in the presence of TGZ. Conversely, overexpression of p65 inhibited induction of a PPAR-gamma-responsive reporter gene by activated PPAR-gamma in a dose-dependent manner. The inhibitory effect was independent of the presence of NF-kappaB-binding sites in the promoter region. Other NF-kappaB family members, p50 and c-Rel as well as the S276A mutant of p65, blocked PPAR-gamma-mediated gene transcription less effectively. Thus, p65 antagonizes the transcriptional regulatory activity of PPAR-gamma in adipocytes, and PPAR-gamma activation can at least partially override the inhibitory effects of p65 on the expression of key adipocyte genes. Our data suggest that inhibition of NF-kappaB activity is a mechanism by which PPAR-gamma agonists improve insulin sensitivity in vivo and that adipocyte NF-kappaB is a potential therapeutic target for obesity-linked type 2 diabetes.					10124	3991	9444	2171	51	6888	51655	10580	9249	949	5105	2180	6772	729359	3295	1050	1376	9054	63924	8694	3910	364	1622	10114	28996

Nitric oxide (NO) can modulate numerous genes directly; however, some genes may be modulated only in the presence of the inflammatory stimuli that increase the expression of the inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). One method by which to examine changes in NO-mediated gene expression is to carry out a gene array analysis on NO-nai;ve cells. Herein, we report a gene array analysis on mRNA from iNOS-null (iNOS(-/-)) mouse hepatocytes harvested from mice exposed to NO by infection with an adenovirus expressing human iNOS (Ad-iNOS). Of the 6500 genes on this array, only approximately 200 were modulated either up or down by the increased iNOS activity according to our criteria for significance. Several clearly defined families of genes were modulated, including genes coding for proinflammatory transcription factors, cytokines, cytokine receptors, proteins associated with cell proliferation and cellular energetics, as well as proteins involved in apoptosis. Our results suggest that iNOS has a generally anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic role in hepatocytes but also acts to suppress proliferation and protein synthesis. The expression of iNOS results in increased expression of stress-related proteins, including heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1). We used HO-1 to confirm that a significant change identified by an analysis could be demonstrated as significant in cells and tissues. The elevation of HO-1 was confirmed at the protein level in hepatocytes in vitro. Furthermore, iNOS(-/-) mice experienced greatly increased liver injury subsequent to intestinal ischemia/reperfusion injury, associated with an inability to upregulate HO-1. This is the first study to address the global gene changes induced by iNOS in any cell type, and the findings presented herein may have clinical relevance for conditions such as septic or hemorrhagic shock in which hepatocytes, NO, and HO-1 play a crucial role.					6611	8882	898	3312	3921	5901	5435	3015	7114	9470	528	1933	2962	203068	4174	5464	3978	133	71	3880	387	7298	6159	1448	2688	4171	4173	10399	8726	6240	47	1639	3925	6723	9159	594839	4175	5134	51082	10808	3475	4087	5931	9592	4784	4738	1465	1022	4803	1017	26472	7936	5784	4282	5879	3162	4860	8027	9463	8761	3148	573	2237	5111	3337	353	3557	6827	7533

In this study, we have examined differences in gene expression in the hypothalamus and cortex of young and aged mice by using high-density oligonucleotide arrays. A number of key genes involved in neuronal structure and signaling are differentially expressed in both the aged hypothalamus and cortex, including synaptotagmin I, cAMP-dependent protein kinase C beta, apolipoprotein E, protein phosphatase 2A, and prostaglandin D. Misregulation of these proteins may contribute to age-related memory deficits and neurodegenerative diseases. In addition, many proteases that play essential roles in regulating neuropeptide metabolism, amyloid precursor protein processing, and neuronal apoptosis are up-regulated in the aged brain and likely contribute significantly to brain aging. Finally, a subset of these genes whose expression is affected by aging are oppositely affected by exposure of mice to an enriched environment, suggesting that these genes may play important roles in learning and memory.					4082	5923	7078	5478	6655	26986	6414	839	1959	60	2891	10209	2045	6229	7431	6434	1633	1363	5550	708	5962	6125	900	4616	5048	8512	291	5052	988	2184	7324	2287	7178	1292	84671	55973

DNA microarrays are powerful tools for the analysis of gene expression on a genomic scale. The importance of individual regulatory events for the process under study can however not be deduced unequivocally without additional experiments. We devised a strategy to identify central regulators of cancer drug responses by combining the results of microarray experiments with efficient methods for phenotypic testing of candidate genes. We exposed murine FL5.12 pro-B cells to cisplatin, camptothecin, methotrexate or paclitaxel, respectively and analysed the patterns of gene expression with cDNA microarrays. Drug-specific regulatory events as well as intersections between different apoptotic pathways, including previously studied responses to staurosporine and interleukin-3 (IL-3) deprivation, were identified. Genes shared by at least three pathways were chosen for further analysis. Ectopic expression of three such genes, TEAP, GP49B, and Lipin1 was found to have an anti-proliferative effect on pro-B cells. Interestingly, we identified hemoglobin alpha as a strong pro-apoptotic regulator. While hemoglobin-expressing cells were growing normally in the presence of IL-3, they displayed accelerated apoptosis with similar kinetics as Bax overexpressing cells upon IL-3 removal. The pro-apoptotic effect of hemoglobin was suppressed by Bcl-2 and was characterized by enhanced stimulation of caspase activity.					5372	4193	23175	900	10628	963	2015	9538	84548	378938	10140	64859	81671	54529	7832	3039	83719	94241	1026	9249	51015	3983

RUAN_RESPONSE_TO_TNF_UP	M1512		12732648	Ruan H,Pownall HJ,Lodish HF		Table 1: Fold-TNFa >= 1.3			SEQ_ACCESSION	John Newman	University of Washington	Adipocyte abundant genes up-regulated in 3T3-L1 cells (fibroblasts induced to differentiate to adipocytes) in response to TNF [GeneID=7124].	Troglitazone (TGZ), a member of the thiazolidinedione class of anti-diabetic compounds and a peroxisome proliferator activator receptor-gamma (PPAR-gamma) agonist, restores systemic insulin sensitivity and improves the full insulin resistance syndrome in vivo. The mechanisms underlying its in vivo function are not understood. Here we investigated the potential functional interaction between PPAR-gamma and NF-kappaB in adipocytes. We show that TGZ selectively blocked tumor necrosis factor-alpha-induced and NF-kappaB-dependent repression of multiple adipocyte-specific genes and induction of growth phase and other genes. This occurs without interfering with NF-kappaB expression, activation, nuclear translocation, or DNA binding and without suppressing NF-kappaB-dependent survival signals. Notably, the expressions of some tumor necrosis factor-alpha-induced genes in adipocytes were unaffected by PPAR-gamma activation. In reporter gene assays in HeLa cells, ectopic expression of PPAR-gamma abolished induction of a NF-kappaB-responsive reporter gene by the p65 subunit (RelA) of NF-kappaB, and the inhibition was further enhanced in the presence of TGZ. Conversely, overexpression of p65 inhibited induction of a PPAR-gamma-responsive reporter gene by activated PPAR-gamma in a dose-dependent manner. The inhibitory effect was independent of the presence of NF-kappaB-binding sites in the promoter region. Other NF-kappaB family members, p50 and c-Rel as well as the S276A mutant of p65, blocked PPAR-gamma-mediated gene transcription less effectively. Thus, p65 antagonizes the transcriptional regulatory activity of PPAR-gamma in adipocytes, and PPAR-gamma activation can at least partially override the inhibitory effects of p65 on the expression of key adipocyte genes. Our data suggest that inhibition of NF-kappaB activity is a mechanism by which PPAR-gamma agonists improve insulin sensitivity in vivo and that adipocyte NF-kappaB is a potential therapeutic target for obesity-linked type 2 diabetes.					3240	6648	2633	19	50848	3459	12	1356	7069	6891	1634	6772
LEE_CALORIE_RESTRICTION_NEOCORTEX_UP	M1513		10888876	Lee CK,Weindruch R,Prolla TA		Table 3S			SEQ_ACCESSION	John Newman	University of Washington	Up-regulated in the neocortex of aged (30-month) mice subjected to caloric restriction since young adulthood.	Ageing of the brain leads to impairments in cognitive and motor skills, and is the major risk factor for several common neurological disorders such as Alzheimer disease (AD) and Parkinson disease (PD). Recent studies suggest that normal brain ageing is associated with subtle morphological and functional alterations in specific neuronal circuits, as opposed to large-scale neuronal loss. In fact, ageing of the central nervous system in diverse mammalian species shares many features, such as atrophy of pyramidal neurons, synaptic atrophy, decrease of striatal dopamine receptors, accumulation of fluorescent pigments, cytoskeletal abnormalities, and reactive astrocytes and microglia. To provide the first global analysis of brain ageing at the molecular level, we used oligonucleotide arrays representing 6,347 genes to determine the gene-expression profile of the ageing neocortex and cerebellum in mice. Ageing resulted in a gene-expression profile indicative of an inflammatory response, oxidative stress and reduced neurotrophic support in both brain regions. At the transcriptional level, brain ageing in mice displays parallels with human neurodegenerative disorders. Caloric restriction, which retards the ageing process in mammals, selectively attenuated the age-associated induction of genes encoding inflammatory and stress responses.					51341	7528	649	24142	25939	5480	5789	3487	5470	2555	1877	1813	344	3439	7076	84681	3219	6403	5971	54107	23400	1815	8848	490	4848	29883	309	203068	7917	2626	5587	3213	1152	5780	51333	7372	4094	11113	361	27347	90231	9757	9451	6558	4985	1907	5813	2171	3135	23764	7059	5111	434	4528	7088	7008	7298	2621	10641	2700	23762	58	7134	8861	4792	23760	5054	7027	1728	4436	2694	2842	1915	3831	3203	9361	55117	10657	1445	5196	5578	1837	7318

HU_GENOTOXIN_ACTION_DIRECT_VS_INDIRECT_4HR	M1516		15120960	Hu T,Gibson DP,Carr GJ,Torontali SM,Tiesman JP,Chaney JG,Aardema MJ		Table 4			SEQ_ACCESSION	John Newman	University of Washington	Genes discriminating between direct (cisplatin, MMS, mitomycin C [PubChem=2767;4156;5746]) and indirect (paclitaxel, hydroxyurea, etoposide [PubChem=4666;3657;36462]) acting genotoxins at 4 h time point.	During the safety evaluation process of new drugs and chemicals, a battery of genotoxicity tests is conducted starting with in vitro genotoxicity assays. Obtaining positive results in in vitro genotoxicity tests is not uncommon. Follow-up studies to determine the biological relevance of positive genotoxicity results are costly, time consuming, and utilize animals. More efficient methods, especially for identifying a putative mode of action like an indirect mechanism of genotoxicity (where DNA molecules are not the initial primary targets), would greatly improve the risk assessment for genotoxins. To this end, we are participating in an International Life Sciences Institute (ILSI) project involving studies of gene expression changes caused by model genotoxins. The purpose of the work is to evaluate gene expression tools in general, and specifically for discriminating genotoxins that are direct-acting from indirect-acting. Our lab has evaluated gene expression changes as well as micronuclei (MN) in L5178Y TK(+/-) mouse lymphoma cells treated with six compounds. Direct-acting genotoxins (where DNA is the initial primary target) that were evaluated included the DNA crosslinking agents, mitomycin C (MMC) and cisplatin (CIS), and an alkylating agent, methyl methanesulfonate (MMS). Indirect-acting genotoxins included hydroxyurea (HU), a ribonucleotide reductase inhibitor, taxol (TXL), a microtubule inhibitor, and etoposide (ETOP), a DNA topoisomerase II inhibitor. Microarray gene expression analysis was conducted using Affymetrix mouse oligonucleotide arrays on RNA samples derived from cells which were harvested immediately after the 4 h chemical treatment, and 20 h after the 4 h chemical treatment. The evaluation of these experimental results yields evidence of differentially regulated genes at both 4 and 24 h time points that appear to have discriminating power for direct versus indirect genotoxins, and therefore may serve as a fingerprint for classifying chemicals when their mechanism of action is unknown.					4792	1196	8829	7450	4117	4016	23760	23635	4841	3759	6656	29058	10051	10450	23545	7316	6591	60	3384	381	3004	10449	571	56912	1755	51554	644096	7532	57035	6506	3845	5213	4170	7376	940	1856	127833

The transcriptional profiles of mouse embryonic, neural, and hematopoietic stem cells were compared to define a genetic program for stem cells. A total of 216 genes are enriched in all three types of stem cells, and several of these genes are clustered in the genome. When compared to differentiated cell types, stem cells express a significantly higher number of genes (represented by expressed sequence tags) whose functions are unknown. Embryonic and neural stem cells have many similarities at the transcriptional level. These results provide a foundation for a more detailed understanding of stem cell biology.					1436	5649	5530	10402	10962	2015	3290	5579	963	10313	94	50856	26999	2123	3040	968	359845	961	161	649	100506736	1052	6556	23184	8522	29	7535	2907	11151	384	1508	219972	5788	122622	3067	2583	9450	140885	27316	8514	4684	3689	9060	8993	1302	7305	79683	51199	4118	274	7923	116143	7462	1471	1215	5525	51466	29993	6001	3925	1520	340527	27351	79641	2934	8829	284023	122618	2891	8535	10636	3983	440400	80303

The tumor suppressor protein BRCA1 has been shown to enhance p53 transcription, whereas activated p53 represses BRCA1 transcription. To further understand the functional interaction of these proteins, we investigated the role of BRCA1 in p53-induced phenotypes. We found that BRCA1 when subjected to forced expression acts synergistically with wild-type p53, resulting in irreversible growth arrest, as shown by VhD mouse fibroblast cells expressing a temperature-sensitive mutant of p53. Furthermore, reintroduction of both BRCA1 and p53 into BRCA1(-/-)/p53(-/-) mouse embryonic fibroblasts markedly increased the senescence phenotype compared to that induced by p53 alone. In particular, we found that BRCA1 expression attenuated p53-mediated cell death in response to gamma-irradiation. Moreover, microarray screening of 11 000 murine genes demonstrated that a set of genes upregulated by p53 is enhanced by coexpression of BRCA1 and p53, suggesting that BRCA1 and p53 exert a promoter selectivity leading to a specific phenotype. Taken together, our results provide evidence that BRCA1 is involved in p53-mediated growth suppression rather than apoptosis.					23175	10278	244	355	5360	1466	64393	23612	130814	6091	900	5168	10140	6038	1606	26207	3713	64065	6303	1026	7157	203	8722	54541	2052	148713	6890	8784	2073	4193	80781	1512	8785	5349	339	1728	140809	5270
LIAN_LIPA_TARGETS_6M	M4345		16127159	Lian X,Yan C,Qin Y,Knox L,Li T,Du H		Table 1S: ko/wt fold 6m >= 2			Mouse430_2	John Newman	University of Washington	Genes up-regulated at 6 months of age in lungs from LIPA [GeneID=3988] knockout mice, which display pulmonary pathology.	The functional roles of neutral lipids in the lung are poorly understood. However, blocking cholesteryl ester and triglyceride metabolism in lysosomal acid lipase gene knockout mice (lal-/-) results in severe pathogenic phenotypes in the lung, including massive neutrophil infiltration, foamy macrophage accumulation, unwanted cell growth, and emphysema. To elucidate the mechanism underlining these pathologies, we performed Affymetrix GeneChip microarray analysis of 1-, 3-, and 6-month-old mice and identified aberrant gene expression that progressed with age. Among changed genes, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-12, apoptosis inhibitor 6 (Api-6), erythroblast transformation-specific domain (Ets) transcription factor family member Spi-C, and oncogene MafB were increased 100-, 70-, 40-, and 10-fold, respectively, in lal-/- lungs versus the wild-type lungs. The pathogenic increases of these molecules occurred primarily in alveolar type II epithelial cells. Transcriptional activities of the MMP-12 and Api-6 promoters were stimulated by Spi-C or MafB in respiratory epithelial cells. Treatment with 9-hydroxyoctadecanoic acids and ciglitazone significantly rescued lal-/- pulmonary inflammation and aberrant gene expression. In addition, both compounds as well as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma inhibited MMP-12 and Api-6 promoter activities. These data suggest that inflammation-triggered cell growth and emphysema during lysosomal acid lipase deficiency are partially caused by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma inactivation.					2214	1179	8685	58533	713	1508	6556	1788	2289	4063	101	2207	8832	4644	58475	30061	5996	339	7850	712	54	25980	10457	719	5199	26253	93978	121599	54209	10261	547	4321	25924	968	820	6280	9935	2212	714	9518	7941	7127	6530	338339	7402	51296	2581	3579	6101	922	5069	2219	4481	3162	4317	667	4327	8513	8482	7503	2920	730249	4322	2213	4758	51744	219855	245972	1230	79689	51284	2173	219972	55859
RUAN_RESPONSE_TO_TNF_TROGLITAZONE_DN	M1524		12732648	Ruan H,Pownall HJ,Lodish HF		Table 1: Fold-TNFa-TGZ =< -1.3			SEQ_ACCESSION	John Newman	University of Washington	Adipocyte abundant genes down-regulated in 3T3-L1 cells (fibroblasts induced to differentiate to adipocytes) in response to troglitazone [PubChem=5591] and TNF [GeneID=7124].	Troglitazone (TGZ), a member of the thiazolidinedione class of anti-diabetic compounds and a peroxisome proliferator activator receptor-gamma (PPAR-gamma) agonist, restores systemic insulin sensitivity and improves the full insulin resistance syndrome in vivo. The mechanisms underlying its in vivo function are not understood. Here we investigated the potential functional interaction between PPAR-gamma and NF-kappaB in adipocytes. We show that TGZ selectively blocked tumor necrosis factor-alpha-induced and NF-kappaB-dependent repression of multiple adipocyte-specific genes and induction of growth phase and other genes. This occurs without interfering with NF-kappaB expression, activation, nuclear translocation, or DNA binding and without suppressing NF-kappaB-dependent survival signals. Notably, the expressions of some tumor necrosis factor-alpha-induced genes in adipocytes were unaffected by PPAR-gamma activation. In reporter gene assays in HeLa cells, ectopic expression of PPAR-gamma abolished induction of a NF-kappaB-responsive reporter gene by the p65 subunit (RelA) of NF-kappaB, and the inhibition was further enhanced in the presence of TGZ. Conversely, overexpression of p65 inhibited induction of a PPAR-gamma-responsive reporter gene by activated PPAR-gamma in a dose-dependent manner. The inhibitory effect was independent of the presence of NF-kappaB-binding sites in the promoter region. Other NF-kappaB family members, p50 and c-Rel as well as the S276A mutant of p65, blocked PPAR-gamma-mediated gene transcription less effectively. Thus, p65 antagonizes the transcriptional regulatory activity of PPAR-gamma in adipocytes, and PPAR-gamma activation can at least partially override the inhibitory effects of p65 on the expression of key adipocyte genes. Our data suggest that inhibition of NF-kappaB activity is a mechanism by which PPAR-gamma agonists improve insulin sensitivity in vivo and that adipocyte NF-kappaB is a potential therapeutic target for obesity-linked type 2 diabetes.					155	1031	1176	225	8991	79191	8535	3421	10518	51655	8639	6319	56729	3295	369	5997	364	346	5827	26994	7263	9370	1675	5207	3099	9249	5468	6517	10400	3417	8204	5348	4594	57678	7174	5004	4023	28996	2194	5091	210	8398

Database			MG_U74Av2	John Newman	University of Washington	Genes enriched in embryonic, neural and hematopoietic stem cells.	The transcriptional profiles of mouse embryonic, neural, and hematopoietic stem cells were compared to define a genetic program for stem cells. A total of 216 genes are enriched in all three types of stem cells, and several of these genes are clustered in the genome. When compared to differentiated cell types, stem cells express a significantly higher number of genes (represented by expressed sequence tags) whose functions are unknown. Embryonic and neural stem cells have many similarities at the transcriptional level. These results provide a foundation for a more detailed understanding of stem cell biology.					79882	3308	54700	9526	10190	84146	54893	96764	64393	7378	10171	6814	51138	5887	7529	4436	4086	2739	8548	5519	54928	116064	7533	9100	6431	8725	1105	7082	2617	8491	9475	2620	54407	571	152503	1841	9057	84365	10413	4706	8801	51077	7543	10247	2073	3842	81887	2549	26269	55975	133015	29969	10240	401251	5134	51303	51474	372	29089	84311	51136	501	9741	7372	23405	1060	8099	5718	83743	29078	5480	63875	10199	10491	8027	8463	7760	51585	7514	6259	8669	51602	23464	56265	7520	55699	55352	6428	84916	5876	84522	4188	24148	64981	5051	9202	64786	26009	29966	55353	51116	595	51186	2690	51575	60436	10049	5717	11196	51103	51001	79071	10528	9196	2058	9497	129401	26057	34	22931	27340	80222	57038	7296	64844	8239	23160	5504	7322	5771	55250	11102	10484	1488	6146	29934	705	153830	5358	3688	121053	39	65117	57157	81545	84881	5635	50813	25820	11222	4087	5464	5921	54819	2730	1653	1026	2273	1982	10040	84897	2149	7174	54965	56916	11260	80789	8398	7205	55341	23528	5311	2017	2941	6631	2671	54853	79077	51193	256949	57703	790	51444	55173	874	3376	6047	26156	1978	92703	29889	11328	8835	285636	5954	2782	3655	2653	5191	9439	8754	57819	3796	3845	7525	51611

The role of nitric oxide (NO) in acute lung injury remains controversial. Although inhaled NO increases oxygenation in clinical trials, inhibiting NO-synthase (NOS) can be protective. To examine the latter, nickel-exposed mice were treated with saline or NOS inhibitor, N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME). Initial microarray analysis of nickel-induced gene expression of saline-treated mice revealed increased inflammatory mediator, matrix injury-repair, and hypoxia-induced factor-mediated sequences and decreased lung-specific (e.g., surfactant-associated protein B and C) sequences. Compared with saline control, L-NAME-treated mice had enhanced survival with attenuated serum nitrate/nitrite, endothelial NOS activity, and lavage neutrophils and protein. Although initial cytokine (i.e., interferon-gamma, interleukins-1beta and -6, macrophage inflammatory protein-2, monocyte chemotactic protein-1, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha) gene expression was similar between groups, subsequent larger cytokine increases only occurred in saline-treated mice. Similarly, surfactant protein gene expression decreased initially in both groups yet was restored subsequently with L-NAME treatment. Interestingly, the role of inducible NOS (iNOS) in these responses seems minimal. iNOS gene expression was unaltered, iNOS activity and nitrotyrosine residues were undetectable, and an iNOS antagonist, aminoguanidine, failed to increase survival. Rather, systemic L-NAME treatment appears to attenuate pulmonary endothelial NOS activity, subsequent cytokine expression, inflammation, and protein permeability, and thereby restores surfactant gene expression and increases survival.					2006	3934	6279	4015	7045	8877	1476	9536	7168	4719	2353	1281	1843	3491	4052	1026	5935	3164	116844	7941	2212	51129	1316	79689	11275	4609	5806	7832	6696	9516	4057	4170	7296	84666	3053	4118	3371	2810	55106	1964	3566	9590	7538	4792	9180

DeltaFosB (a truncated form of FosB) and CREB (cAMP response element binding protein) are transcription factors induced in the brain's reward pathways after chronic exposure to drugs of abuse. However, their mechanisms of action and the genes they regulate remain unclear. Using microarray analysis in the nucleus accumbens of inducible transgenic mice, we found that CREB and a dominant-negative CREB have opposite effects on gene expression, as do prolonged expression of DeltaFosB and the activator protein-1 (AP-1) antagonist DeltacJun. However, unlike CREB, short-term and prolonged DeltaFosB induction had opposing effects on gene expression. Gene expression induced by short-term DeltaFosB and by CREB was strikingly similar, and both reduced the rewarding effects of cocaine, whereas prolonged DeltaFosB expression increased drug reward. Gene expression after a short cocaine treatment was more dependent on CREB, whereas gene expression after a longer cocaine treatment became increasingly DeltaFosB dependent. These findings help define the molecular functions of CREB and DeltaFosB and identify clusters of genes that contribute to cocaine addiction.					4121	276	9079	5727	217	1717	55082	25929	139728	23705	60	23250	51130	7201	55704	81572	10927	27086	5090	8864	8848	5179	2114	4826	7008	5456	10788	6664	27122	5797	1291	5318	7296	127933	54976	9362	2885	8447	5173	6496	10157	26137	9716	377	8829	81579	8566	5325	5583	6500	1407	9001	10616	3739	388585	27161	2035

Sonic Hedgehog is a secreted morphogen involved in patterning a wide range of structures in the developing embryo. Disruption of the Hedgehog signalling cascade leads to a number of developmental disorders and plays a key role in the formation of a range of human cancers. The identification of genes regulated by Hedgehog is crucial to understanding how disruption of this pathway leads to neoplastic transformation. We have used a Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) responsive mouse cell line, C3H/10T1/2, to provide a model system for hedgehog target gene discovery. Following activation of cell cultures with Shh, RNA was used to interrogate microarrays to investigate downstream transcriptional consequences of hedgehog stimulation. As a result 11 target genes have been identified, seven of which are induced (Thrombomodulin, GILZ, BF-2, Nr4a1, IGF2, PMP22, LASP1) and four of which are repressed (SFRP-1, SFRP-2, Mip1-gamma, Amh) by Shh. These targets have a diverse range of putative functions and include transcriptional regulators and molecules known to be involved in regulating cell growth or apoptosis. The corroboration of genes previously implicated in hedgehog signalling, along with the finding of novel targets, demonstrates both the validity and power of the C3H/10T1/2 system for Shh target gene discovery.					5376	3164	3481	7056	1831	2297	3927

During the safety evaluation process of new drugs and chemicals, a battery of genotoxicity tests is conducted starting with in vitro genotoxicity assays. Obtaining positive results in in vitro genotoxicity tests is not uncommon. Follow-up studies to determine the biological relevance of positive genotoxicity results are costly, time consuming, and utilize animals. More efficient methods, especially for identifying a putative mode of action like an indirect mechanism of genotoxicity (where DNA molecules are not the initial primary targets), would greatly improve the risk assessment for genotoxins. To this end, we are participating in an International Life Sciences Institute (ILSI) project involving studies of gene expression changes caused by model genotoxins. The purpose of the work is to evaluate gene expression tools in general, and specifically for discriminating genotoxins that are direct-acting from indirect-acting. Our lab has evaluated gene expression changes as well as micronuclei (MN) in L5178Y TK(+/-) mouse lymphoma cells treated with six compounds. Direct-acting genotoxins (where DNA is the initial primary target) that were evaluated included the DNA crosslinking agents, mitomycin C (MMC) and cisplatin (CIS), and an alkylating agent, methyl methanesulfonate (MMS). Indirect-acting genotoxins included hydroxyurea (HU), a ribonucleotide reductase inhibitor, taxol (TXL), a microtubule inhibitor, and etoposide (ETOP), a DNA topoisomerase II inhibitor. Microarray gene expression analysis was conducted using Affymetrix mouse oligonucleotide arrays on RNA samples derived from cells which were harvested immediately after the 4 h chemical treatment, and 20 h after the 4 h chemical treatment. The evaluation of these experimental results yields evidence of differentially regulated genes at both 4 and 24 h time points that appear to have discriminating power for direct versus indirect genotoxins, and therefore may serve as a fingerprint for classifying chemicals when their mechanism of action is unknown.					4736	9531	7280	8140	3301	3149	3376	29766	1013	3002	3727	1978	780	55272	9709	641638	8815	51398	6122	29968	468	5272	834	55509	64859	3014	9636	924	10797	1938	8335	5832	51691	6509	10289

This procedure may be adapted to any transgenic strain, providing a rapid and efficient method to dissect the function of specific genes in glomerular development.					143	148713	54621	5274	9659	9107	23092	8239	375387	3680	205428	2034	51100	23196	57007	5813	94241	27253	5787	7525	54625	8780	116984	4430	55075	80315	2982	54861	80853	79739	169200	29766	1879	6814	9922	92912	26509	1968	8999	387597	421	5359	492311	6314	223082	219623	150094	2817	4907	163782	538	9765	23531	831	130507	9750	84251	80177	7852	84525	10049	2700	55599	3716	1845	4641	4249	27123	1803	10763	51274	55161	116931	474344	64123	10892	2167	122786	388272	64376	9732	23081	7091	64321	56892	115201	132660	57194	222255	10367	121512	55788	3631	6557	8516	23670	57515	51196	126669	23052	5118	153129	8864	55652	1051	9321	29071	2625	56994	9314	51542	9788	53405	55251	51646	6446	55754	9935	57579	1287	5229	54542	5504	132720	276	2321	4534	25780	7336	11096	8898	6926	667	2296	85403	23678	22800	7903	85004	10411	23635	55884	3304	55276	23499	55916	6093	64114	7078	22862	9663	79683	22899	170575	6764	9425	3087	23392	57221	55796	9839	90332	133	84132	7827	23032	1387	51560	55568	8510	145781	63940	155038	55214	9723	4739	9351	64398	83699	5793	1536	2581	952	85461	399665	55089	2917	56987	9846	57561	259230	22903	79026	51454	79812	5423	11151	116254	51232	651746	3561	6558	2444	23109	3320	9172	7168	10846	1629	2957	10048	359948	9748	26051	23362	5930	22885	419	84612	83595	1410	1456	9439	91663	4883	4026	55333	10203	5654	23022	81839	9771	51294	80854	3142	51776	639	10217	23325	253827	23621	64761	84898	1602	30844	1827	51663	1657	10580	22908	3475	5445	55742	22980	57659	3696	55114	6651	55959	5337	196740	961	57458	9037	63898	1837	4005	3588	220965	57590	3092	3707	3693	8405	5997	93624	11343	3303	5583	58494	23370	1950	9444	51701	5334	79905	54463	3676	10791	140885	23164	107	23239	284119	23232	23034	153579	7010	5243	1730	50618	948	25852	1910	23431	1997	7057	51571	301	11000	22905	23161	57480	5592	55745	140685	51022	57820	161198	51714	7422	2557	114799	114879	54704	51115	2934	644943	51136	10150	57716	5800	53358	1948	1200	26207	9990	83478	221395	7844	8556	283131	256302	9079	57520	3988	357	285172	57509	285636	1130	137492	115294	889	79670	8837	84570	10402	6772	79567	10019	84632	11346	142891	1808	2047	53844	51290	11217	4170	25778	2920	4356	56907	2762	7056	25945	9911	90701	80219	9180	79780	58508	1490	203	3977	369	2992	6383	142685	84272	4071	117583	10659	7431	9252	83938	9044	5908	54453	65065	10788	23284	5926	83591	132430	805	353116	90693	23262	154091	1303	9710	3029	222171	4168	256435	84263	10370	8440	23369	127428	23299	55603	387496	57089	3855	51631	114793	256987	57223	345757	10100	57551	64854	59277	23255	6801	5155	81027	8611	170690	83857	9456	2534	185	57619	28951	154810	9863	8816	5795	323	4642	25851	9575	5899	387263	170384	55032	25782	4137	23608	4010	4163	253260	344595	123355	200734	25976	25819	57088	25938	3827	259217	9627	408	5788	1604	9910	8754	5937	23371	7360	10129	22795	1003	55432	55790	2113	9611	7220	5142	863	6453	9197	3096	400451	284207	91768	255394	80267	389136	4643	25960	23592	10098	3987	5209	23143	23368	91452	7403	6943	29068	80005	84458	7103	10231	4811	51	10602	51566	83734	116159	6738	9849	552	58487	57404	253782	653121	6867	6655	11080	80896	3344	80014	116068	3430	6788	2782	126961	152273	10395	203547	23189	1875	1947	2303	5552	11069	64711	57161	4208	6990	2820	153364	29775	10114	1398	6249	8560	22936	801	10434	30845	307	57132	6619	3097	114905	9182	5578	2313	2182	3799	144402	4750	60592	26273	55000	57567	22875	9034	56957	10818	29094	1832	151613	79577	57120	7098	4121	2669	133686	57514	1285	115677	9424	4792	54556	7049	5327	1520	11037	23554	10735	5089	55852	55243	56851	79086	4982	4855	5352	163590	976	373	5205	55303	4646	5782	221981	23095	54497	8347	4783	54891	7369	11244	541565	114990	57608	9208	84159	387751	91894	10979	80243	3720	192670	23493	285527	868	3423	29970	79822	79960	55870	6578	6319	23230	8847	113263	6744	2846	201627	56829	7099	51105	8613	65124	158747	9467	54664	25937	23527	162681	5814	26503	83543	5562	4254	7128	4139	6515	644150	648	4008	6049	57451	29761	56920	987	5922	5138	8439	55824	55207	54585	9517	79647	9563	54629	83992	50999	81035	3927	23500	10290	858	7414	131583	3688	1647	51705	1028	6845	10955	57606	9728	51760	56674	3572	120103	23461	201501	1286	92815	441027	10133	10140	51088	84981	9953	55561	9920	2078	64776	79145	256949	657	81553	51267	27237	55777	55312	66008	817	10529	5144	3021	8773	340485	5734	4012	26524	157695	375743	7739	285513	51460	9411	5290	199870	11342	149371	5025	8436	399687	3384	9969	10461	79652	3597	489	2009	4215	6668	2802	8707	4651	1486	132864	157378	147463	51309	57189	114822	79646	9166	51230	4017	152926	405	1783	394	162394	146760	2869	3667	867	7869	494143	64778	64236	1848	55454	10746	26994	6332	375449	84189	7048	5906	7280	23272	200894	60526	6239	7543	1179	93986	26084	9706	115330	8829	5627	3267	64423	114882	116447	23216	11030	4905	81537	1580	3006	10628

The mammalian SIN3 complex consists of histone deacetylases (HDAC1, HDAC2), several known proteins (SAP30, N-CoR) and as yet unidentified proteins. Here we show that the mouse tetradecanoyl phorbol acetate induced sequence 7 (TIS7) protein is a novel transcriptional co-repressor that can associate with the SIN3 complex. We have identified tis7 as a gene that is up-regulated upon loss of polarity in a mouse mammary gland epithelial cell line expressing an estrogen-inducible c-JunER fusion protein. In unpolarized cells, TIS7 protein levels increase and TIS7 translocates into the nucleus. Overexpression of tis7 causes loss of polarity and represses a set of genes, as revealed by cDNA microarray analysis. We have shown that TIS7 protein interacts with several proteins of the SIN3 complex (mSin3B, HDAC1, N-CoR and SAP30) by yeast two-hybrid screening and co-immunoprecipitations. TIS7 co-immunoprecipitated HDAC complex is enzymatically active and represses a GAL4-dependent reporter transcription. The transcriptional repression of endogenous genes by tis7 overexpression is HDAC dependent. Thus, we propose TIS7 as a transcriptional co-repressor affecting the expression of specific genes in a HDAC activity-dependent manner during cell fate decisions, e.g. scattering.					10406	200916	6139	29796	6210	65991	5478	55527	81611	4488	9232	6696	1491	3855	7083	1382	1522	54463	4626	477	7979	10682	9412
PAL_PRMT5_TARGETS_UP	M10688		15485929	Pal S,Vishwanath SN,Erdjument-Bromage H,Tempst P,Sif S		Table 1S			MG_U74Av2	John Newman	University of Washington	Genes up-regulated in NIH-3T3 cells (fibroblast) after knockdown of PRMT5 [GeneID=10419] by RNAi.	Protein arginine methyltransferases (PRMTs) have been implicated in transcriptional activation and repression, but their role in controlling cell growth and proliferation remains obscure. We have recently shown that PRMT5 can interact with flag-tagged BRG1- and hBRM-based hSWI/SNF chromatin remodelers and that both complexes can specifically methylate histones H3 and H4. Here we report that PRMT5 can be found in association with endogenous hSWI/SNF complexes, which can methylate H3 and H4 N-terminal tails, and show that H3 arginine 8 and H4 arginine 3 are preferred sites of methylation by recombinant and hSWI/SNF-associated PRMT5. To elucidate the role played by PRMT5 in gene regulation, we have established a PRMT5 antisense cell line and determined by microarray analysis that more genes are derepressed when PRMT5 levels are reduced. Among the affected genes, we show that suppressor of tumorigenicity 7 (ST7) and nonmetastatic 23 (NM23) are direct targets of PRMT5-containing BRG1 and hBRM complexes. Furthermore, we demonstrate that expression of ST7 and NM23 is reduced in a cell line that overexpresses PRMT5 and that this decrease in expression correlates with H3R8 methylation, H3K9 deacetylation, and increased transformation of NIH 3T3 cells. These findings suggest that the BRG1- and hBRM-associated PRMT5 regulates cell growth and proliferation by controlling expression of genes involved in tumor suppression.					5796	2620	3476	5311	1982	57035	328	54108	4288	6431	4830	10559	84858	1019	2697	5764	10112	7284	3308	1164	4841	3191	22916	5099	1479	6387	79004	9040	7272	53635	51466	3925	5935	8904	947	4802	8502	55052	4082	8533	11171	9493	4860	6605	27258	9733	9589	85440	5627	3838	4781	6426	2969	9319	6432	2619	11073	4233	54820	7982	171546	10329	57381	9133	5933	6240	10919	7529	1163	4714	9429	4173	8520	5325	2332	23317	5558	808	2288	54998	10015	6418	3148	56474	11168	1462	3014	1894	4171	1891	1070	2014	92675	4016	55656	81611	9789	55193	23435	84337	4692	84316	7026	2990	79042	55089	2954	8270	27068	3609	5693	51079	51642	7072	9212	10460	63979	4790	10498	9994	2290	4684	29128	7025	10946	5985	51747	6626	51155	5557	10541	54460	191	10536	3070	54801	55082	27077	29074	10428	83460	11338	1545	23568	3619	11167	292	1374	129401	55213	7112	79711	4134	7884	1069	7280	6423	10631	991	9768	284371	29127	23464	23530	1487	51602	1292	5955	5702	3654	4267	1183	5510	57819	715	51053	79971	3832	401505	51433	9861	1892	1687	51574	6118	10477	81892	5921	3712	4927	25764	995	3398	5427	4953	94239	27166	7045	79902	112464	822	57038	3037

Zmpste24 (also called FACE-1) is a metalloproteinase involved in the maturation of lamin A (Lmna), an essential component of the nuclear envelope. Both Zmpste24- and Lmna-deficient mice exhibit profound nuclear architecture abnormalities and multiple histopathological defects that phenocopy an accelerated ageing process. Similarly, diverse human progeroid syndromes are caused by mutations in ZMPSTE24 or LMNA genes. To elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying these devastating diseases, we have analysed the transcriptional alterations occurring in tissues from Zmpste24-deficient mice. We demonstrate that Zmpste24 deficiency elicits a stress signalling pathway that is evidenced by a marked upregulation of p53 target genes, and accompanied by a senescence phenotype at the cellular level and accelerated ageing at the organismal level. These phenotypes are largely rescued in Zmpste24-/-Lmna+/- mice and partially reversed in Zmpste24-/-p53-/- mice. These findings provide evidence for the existence of a checkpoint response activated by the nuclear abnormalities caused by prelamin A accumulation, and support the concept that hyperactivation of the tumour suppressor p53 may cause accelerated ageing.					25819	1645	3818	1376	50486	8876	3429	3927	224	55365	58505	7535	28970	58476	3483	670	22822	216	1317	7503	3028	229	761	145264	912	5009	847	27284	131076	11185	92840	3422	2326	3633	1962	2168	6281	9104
JIANG_AGING_HYPOTHALAMUS_DN	M1535		11172053	Jiang CH,Tsien JZ,Schultz PG,Hu Y		Table 1, 3S: FC < -2			Mu11KsubA	John Newman	University of Washington	Down-regulated in the hypothalamus of aged (22 months) BALB/c mice, compared to young (2 months) controls	A better understanding of the molecular effects of aging in the brain may help to reveal important aspects of organismal aging, as well as processes that lead to age-related brain dysfunction. In this study, we have examined differences in gene expression in the hypothalamus and cortex of young and aged mice by using high-density oligonucleotide arrays. A number of key genes involved in neuronal structure and signaling are differentially expressed in both the aged hypothalamus and cortex, including synaptotagmin I, cAMP-dependent protein kinase C beta, apolipoprotein E, protein phosphatase 2A, and prostaglandin D. Misregulation of these proteins may contribute to age-related memory deficits and neurodegenerative diseases. In addition, many proteases that play essential roles in regulating neuropeptide metabolism, amyloid precursor protein processing, and neuronal apoptosis are up-regulated in the aged brain and likely contribute significantly to brain aging. Finally, a subset of these genes whose expression is affected by aging are oppositely affected by exposure of mice to an enriched environment, suggesting that these genes may play important roles in learning and memory.					821	3799	1173	10294	50	43	1915	5567	1742	488	482	6301	1642	9500	5518	22907	2034	10079	10490	527	5730	22931	10963	2664	2890	2058	7447	23646	348	6857	818	4247	1759	7316	1431	2771	537	1363	2879	529

We have analyzed the developmental molecular programs of the mouse hippocampus, a cortical structure critical for learning and memory, by means of large-scale DNA microarray techniques. Of 11,000 genes and expressed sequence tags examined, 1,926 showed dynamic changes during hippocampal development from embryonic day 16 to postnatal day 30. Gene-cluster analysis was used to group these genes into 16 distinct clusters with striking patterns that appear to correlate with major developmental hallmarks and cellular events. These include genes involved in neuronal proliferation, differentiation, and synapse formation. A complete list of the transcriptional changes has been compiled into a comprehensive gene profile database (http://BrainGenomics.Princeton.edu), which should prove valuable in advancing our understanding of the molecular and genetic programs underlying both the development and the functions of the mammalian brain.					10477	2173	60	3897	1282	3371	1000	10574	8829	7277	7317	6713	203068	2224	10752	10381	10575	71	7278	6897	8128	7846	72	347733	2335	22948	10694	23326	4023	50804	4684	4323	2171	2194	6902

DeltaFosB (a truncated form of FosB) and CREB (cAMP response element binding protein) are transcription factors induced in the brain's reward pathways after chronic exposure to drugs of abuse. However, their mechanisms of action and the genes they regulate remain unclear. Using microarray analysis in the nucleus accumbens of inducible transgenic mice, we found that CREB and a dominant-negative CREB have opposite effects on gene expression, as do prolonged expression of DeltaFosB and the activator protein-1 (AP-1) antagonist DeltacJun. However, unlike CREB, short-term and prolonged DeltaFosB induction had opposing effects on gene expression. Gene expression induced by short-term DeltaFosB and by CREB was strikingly similar, and both reduced the rewarding effects of cocaine, whereas prolonged DeltaFosB expression increased drug reward. Gene expression after a short cocaine treatment was more dependent on CREB, whereas gene expression after a longer cocaine treatment became increasingly DeltaFosB dependent. These findings help define the molecular functions of CREB and DeltaFosB and identify clusters of genes that contribute to cocaine addiction.					81849	2890	22924	7153	10391	54532	6844	6812	815	9493	1647	114823	757	51686	27020	112755	2006	135	8864	2803	2571	10382	81622	6595	5142	87	1490	5153	56889	66036	23367	7102	482	4900	55294	961	84867	8971	9806	6663	81533	89781	10716	28969	3751	5451	8073	4686	6457	6391	885	55178	8945	6855	4189	5064	160	6624	1742	3309	752	5179	5819	2011	51729	10659	10097	54976	1958	51412	10458	3868	3728	2893	6397	55799	134	51621	4753

The activation of muscle-specific gene expression requires the coordinated action of muscle regulatory proteins and chromatin-remodeling enzymes. Microarray analysis performed in the presence or absence of a dominant-negative BRG1 ATPase demonstrated that approximately one-third of MyoD-induced genes were highly dependent on SWI/SNF enzymes. To understand the mechanism of activation, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitations analyzing the myogenin promoter. We found that H4 hyperacetylation preceded Brg1 binding in a MyoD-dependent manner but that MyoD binding occurred subsequent to H4 modification and Brg1 interaction. In the absence of functional SWI/SNF enzymes, muscle regulatory proteins did not bind to the myogenin promoter, thereby providing evidence for SWI/SNF-dependent activator binding. We observed that the homeodomain factor Pbx1, which cooperates with MyoD to stimulate myogenin expression, is constitutively bound to the myogenin promoter in a SWI/SNF-independent manner, suggesting a two-step mechanism in which MyoD initially interacts indirectly with the myogenin promoter and attracts chromatin-remodeling enzymes, which then facilitate direct binding by MyoD and other regulatory proteins.					8519	7056	7175	10409	80727	2634	3149	27153	5355	120534	7045	84034	79019	9353	1316	6387	5272	134429	1808	4257	3709	23613	53917	114990	11346	83439	9553	8321	6383	9509	1903	55794	143098	5427	10549	134957	1528	55914	4313	10458	10631	23318	11030	527	23360	827	1301	947	149473	1649	51412	25960	5142	5728	961	100381270	6526

Elongin A is a transcription elongation factor that increases the overall rate of mRNA chain elongation by RNA polymerase II. To investigate the function of Elongin A in vivo, the two alleles of the Elongin A gene have been disrupted by homologous recombination in murine embryonic stem (ES) cells. The Elongin A-deficient ES cells are viable, but show a slow growth phenotype because they undergo a delayed mitosis. The cDNA microarray and RNase protection assay using the wild-type and Elongin A-deficient ES cells indicate that the expression of only a small subset of genes is affected in the mutant cells. Taken together, our results suggest that Elongin A regulates transcription of a subset but not all of genes and reveal a linkage between Elongin A function and cell cycle progression.					3688	10138	8974	10205	2050	6615	7263	2230	283807	22837	2530	57182	57713	9057	2778	894	1592	83693	22862	2627	3491	10809	5153	3815	2199	1471	2907	10150	3727	23576	9709	124872	5352	2131	6238	10370	3915	4043	5660	64778	801	710	5327	6678	3339	4634	7276	1287	9413	1410	5033	388403	2034	5034	10959	6541	10905	463	8673	8795	5641	55788	23136	4435	4624	7837	7035	84146	90993	302	56990	3223	1522	2752	80025	871	2690	9957	11135	2152	100170841	6566	3309	23767	892	3912	3487	813	2790	80031	8910	203522	267	11328	89970	7078	10266	56241	5797	11015	8445	6695	4811	57556	2923	1003	2590	29780	5745	58477	6690	343	571	2799	23348	64854	378	84141	7026	5780	23193	8454	387521	351	4026	5954	6934	22795	220002	55119	29969	5351	10943	1284	64321	7791	8997	7056	5045	1514	57513	952	2028	1192	23186	64388	92912	6303	2681	5723	7422	4240	567	2768	64220	481	80206	7453	3398	6836	7301	30008	3164	30851	5552	537	81539	51421	59274	1282	23071	284217	1191	11014	10915

During the safety evaluation process of new drugs and chemicals, a battery of genotoxicity tests is conducted starting with in vitro genotoxicity assays. Obtaining positive results in in vitro genotoxicity tests is not uncommon. Follow-up studies to determine the biological relevance of positive genotoxicity results are costly, time consuming, and utilize animals. More efficient methods, especially for identifying a putative mode of action like an indirect mechanism of genotoxicity (where DNA molecules are not the initial primary targets), would greatly improve the risk assessment for genotoxins. To this end, we are participating in an International Life Sciences Institute (ILSI) project involving studies of gene expression changes caused by model genotoxins. The purpose of the work is to evaluate gene expression tools in general, and specifically for discriminating genotoxins that are direct-acting from indirect-acting. Our lab has evaluated gene expression changes as well as micronuclei (MN) in L5178Y TK(+/-) mouse lymphoma cells treated with six compounds. Direct-acting genotoxins (where DNA is the initial primary target) that were evaluated included the DNA crosslinking agents, mitomycin C (MMC) and cisplatin (CIS), and an alkylating agent, methyl methanesulfonate (MMS). Indirect-acting genotoxins included hydroxyurea (HU), a ribonucleotide reductase inhibitor, taxol (TXL), a microtubule inhibitor, and etoposide (ETOP), a DNA topoisomerase II inhibitor. Microarray gene expression analysis was conducted using Affymetrix mouse oligonucleotide arrays on RNA samples derived from cells which were harvested immediately after the 4 h chemical treatment, and 20 h after the 4 h chemical treatment. The evaluation of these experimental results yields evidence of differentially regulated genes at both 4 and 24 h time points that appear to have discriminating power for direct versus indirect genotoxins, and therefore may serve as a fingerprint for classifying chemicals when their mechanism of action is unknown.					5757	221092	10049	51668	51176	92140	65124	509	26277	10013	10492	7324	3106	8347	10539	116150	7203	6917	4691	7936	90993	4485	720	83719	2014	8784	55974	6801	64342	57409	84792	4682	10953	10922	91544	7803	8539	3619	3851	5925	5683	4247	81542	3726	51493	11313	4869	55824	23149	9908	328	7153	60626	3652	5931

Recent studies suggest that normal brain ageing is associated with subtle morphological and functional alterations in specific neuronal circuits, as opposed to large-scale neuronal loss. In fact, ageing of the central nervous system in diverse mammalian species shares many features, such as atrophy of pyramidal neurons, synaptic atrophy, decrease of striatal dopamine receptors, accumulation of fluorescent pigments, cytoskeletal abnormalities, and reactive astrocytes and microglia. To provide the first global analysis of brain ageing at the molecular level, we used oligonucleotide arrays representing 6,347 genes to determine the gene-expression profile of the ageing neocortex and cerebellum in mice. Ageing resulted in a gene-expression profile indicative of an inflammatory response, oxidative stress and reduced neurotrophic support in both brain regions. At the transcriptional level, brain ageing in mice displays parallels with human neurodegenerative disorders. Caloric restriction, which retards the ageing process in mammals, selectively attenuated the age-associated induction of genes encoding inflammatory and stress responses.					5797	818	51202	51807	833	9452	9022	3308	58498	2173	1589	9341	150	342527	310	6620	4205	4635	1510	4508	6521	10121	6919	1418	51347	4843	4665	4094	64854	1390	11107	55117	786	5105	2584	5789	51741	1267	7375	442721	8761	1308	1808	8775	1437	331	10643	43	6622	1628	3491	2170	3083	51293	4948	7478	2538	4625	7546	7057	157	3010	4791	23761	10660	653145	64130	5068	6624	10461	920	6597	2475	871	53916	8447	2193	55776	58	8629	3371	4886	9572	595	7318	9785

Mouse mutations have provided tremendous insights into the molecular basis of renal and glomerular development. However, genes often play important roles during multiple stages of nephrogenesis, making it difficult to determine the role of a gene in a specific cell lineage such as the podocyte. Conditional gene targeting and chimeric analysis are two possible approaches to dissect the function of genes in specific cell populations. However, these are labor-intensive and costly and require the generation, validation, and analysis of additional transgenic lines. For overcoming these shortcomings and, specifically, for studying the role of gene function in developing glomeruli, a technique to isolate and purify glomeruli from murine embryos was developed. Combined with gene expression profiling, this method was used to identify differentially expressed genes in glomeruli from Pod1 knockout (KO) mice that die in the perinatal period with multiple renal defects. Glomeruli from early developing stages (late S-shape/early capillary loop) onward can be isolated successfully from wild-type and KO kidneys at 18.5 d postcoitus, and RNA can readily be obtained and used for genome-wide microarray analysis. With this approach, 3986 genes that are differently expressed between glomeruli from Pod1 KO and wild-type mice were identified, including a four-fold reduction of alpha 8 integrin mRNA in glomeruli from Pod1 KO mice that was confirmed by immunostaining. This procedure may be adapted to any transgenic strain, providing a rapid and efficient method to dissect the function of specific genes in glomerular development.					116447	1285	7099	1604	84251	10788	7827	6319	4137	1950	2557	132720	644943	10846	148713	10461	9723	419	7369	3304	2581	53405	83699	10100	114822	5734	143	133	9208	6558	3303

Diminished activity of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARgamma) may play a role in the pathogenesis of hypertension and vascular dysfunction. To better understand what genes are regulated by PPARgamma, an experimental data set was generated by microarray analysis, in duplicate, of pooled aortic mRNA isolated from mice treated for 21 days with a PPARgamma agonist (rosiglitazone) or vehicle. Of the 12,488 probe sets present on the array (Affymetrix MG-U74Av2), 181 were differentially expressed between groups according to a statistical metric generated using Affymetrix software. A significant correlation was observed between the microarray results and real-time RT-PCR analysis of 39 of these genes. Cluster analysis revealed 3 expression patterns, 29 transcripts of moderate abundance that were decreased (-93%) to very low levels, 106 transcripts that were downregulated (-42%), and 46 transcripts that were upregulated (+70%). Functional groups that were decreased included inflammatory response (-93%, n = 6), immune response (-86%, n = 7), and cytokines (-82%, n = 7). There was an overall upregulation in the oxidoreductase activity group (+47%, n = 9). Individually, six transcripts in this group were increased (+72%), and three were decreased (-34%). Fourteen of the genes map to regions in the rat genome that have been linked to increased blood pressure, and of 142 upstream regions analyzed, sequences resembling the DNA binding site for PPARgamma were identified in 101 of the differentially expressed genes.					55699	4712	729359	128240	138311	5465	1066	3329	2170	57679	57104	364	10518	30	25813	10580	7423	1743	10063	283337	55856	1580	9040	134147	4716	4722	5190	8322	27089	292	51073	208	10628	140823	219743	518	6390	8694

Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) is implicated in the maintenance of genomic integrity, given that inhibition or depletion of this enzyme increases genomic instability in cells exposed to genotoxic agents. We previously showed that immortalized fibroblasts derived from PARP(-/-) mice exhibit an unstable tetraploid population, and partial chromosomal gains and losses in PARP(-/-) mice and immortalized fibroblasts are accompanied by changes in the expression of p53, Rb, and c-Jun, as well as other proteins. A tetraploid population has also now been detected in primary fibroblasts derived from PARP(-/-) mice. Oligonucleotide microarray analysis was applied to characterize more comprehensively the differences in gene expression between asynchronously dividing primary fibroblasts derived from PARP(-/-) mice and their wild-type littermates. Of the 11,000 genes monitored, 91 differentially expressed genes were identified. The loss of PARP results in down-regulation of the expression of several genes involved in regulation of cell cycle progression or mitosis, DNA replication, or chromosomal processing or assembly. PARP deficiency also up-regulates genes that encode extracellular matrix or cytoskeletal proteins that are implicated in cancer initiation or progression or in normal or premature aging. These results provide insight into the mechanism by which PARP deficiency impairs mitotic function, thereby resulting in the genomic alterations and chromosomal abnormalities as well as in altered expression of genes that may contribute to genomic instability, cancer, and aging.					900	2252	8076	51450	351	1938	1287	2017	2878	203	3397	4193	7078	2006	4856	1295	857	3489	975	1026	595	1634	10468	5270	4256	7077	894	3487	6277	306	64129

Alternative RNA splicing greatly increases proteome diversity and may thereby contribute to tissue-specific functions. We carried out genome-wide quantitative analysis of alternative splicing using a custom Affymetrix microarray to assess the role of the neuronal splicing factor Nova in the brain. We used a stringent algorithm to identify 591 exons that were differentially spliced in the brain relative to immune tissues, and 6.6% of these showed major splicing defects in the neocortex of Nova2-/- mice. We tested 49 exons with the largest predicted Nova-dependent splicing changes and validated all 49 by RT-PCR. We analyzed the encoded proteins and found that all those with defined brain functions acted in the synapse (34 of 40, including neurotransmitter receptors, cation channels, adhesion and scaffold proteins) or in axon guidance (8 of 40).

Mechanisms regulating self-renewal and cell fate decisions in mammalian stem cells are poorly understood. We determined global gene expression profiles for mouse and human hematopoietic stem cells and other stages of the hematopoietic hierarchy. Murine and human hematopoietic stem cells share a number of expressed gene products, which define key conserved regulatory pathways in this developmental system. Moreover, in the mouse, a portion of the genetic program of hematopoietic stem cells is shared with embryonic and neural stem cells. This overlapping set of gene products represents a molecular signature of stem cells.					6988	7475	10499	9900	51361	2099	2117	23164	92312	94160	3680	85463	25830	6654	10788	1571	10061	3373	2051	90637	3675	28981	54873	80760	27075	50511	51101	27179	6319	164127	4784	6854	26207	114088	2012	6595	4929	150864	4092	9962	5592	374407	2794	3853	55870	80059	7003	5527	84552	152579	79876	54538	9547	390816	64221	10421	10018	2846	10906	3763	10263	54910	64283	670	1944	140606	80014	7203	23613	55295	9655	55131	26137	23261	5226	57633	2022	253512	4736	353116	10605	9378	92979	6844	54839	223117	2332	4651	54904	1140	79834	8986	53981	1123	8973	124540	10957	54799	23077	9369	55353	1282	1901	6925	26257	29965	6382	9978	79144	4773	25847	768206	5930	143872	9694	5837	64282	55607	137492	5567	957	5581	54815	92421	130074	23328	8495	54849	90187	100126572	83786	9733	88	441884	3798	22837	84614	6915	442425	79870	5562	1208	6817	23208	55964	8800	1846	1958	189	143241	55661	9993	2625	51705	79960	5796	9743	7105	116372	5311	5271	22980	23764	5947	10561	64753	9706	90362	9736	200232	9353	129049	5871	1847	286183	5430	5345	51655	57722	7798	9573	5132	9169	27345	56667	8727	22949	84163	1453	1565	23137	3725	54901	323	23331	4916	388611	56265	134218	4794	79603	55749	6478	2115	2669	84640	23270	64135	64180	140700	158586	57683	8233	60598	10612	9121	51574	6498	130589	10725	220382	5105	10123	140890	7436	26509	2926	5218	341947	4975	5978	254428	3636	6276	1788	80781	3164	153770	114770	54541	79867	4792	266629	222553	26330	100506540	4855	286151	57687	10763	57648	7094	5142	9915

Peptide growth factors regulate cell fate by activating distinct signal transduction pathways that ultimately influence gene expression. Insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) play central roles in controlling somatic growth and participate in skeletal muscle development and regeneration. In cultured muscle cells, IGF action is critical both for maintaining viability during the transition from proliferating to differentiating myoblasts and for facilitating differentiation. By contrast, platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) can sustain cell survival but inhibits differentiation. Here we examine the genetic programs that accompany IGF and PDGF action in myoblasts. Through analysis of high-density oligonucleotide arrays containing approximately 36,000 mouse probe sets, we identify 90 transcripts differentially induced by IGF-I, including 28 muscle-specific genes and 33 previously unannotated mRNAs, and 55 transcripts specifically stimulated by PDGF, including 14 unknowns. Detailed study of one IGF-induced mRNA shows that it encodes a protein related to a recently characterized repulsive guidance molecule postulated to regulate neuronal targeting during development. Our results demonstrate the power of transcriptional profiling for gene discovery and provide opportunities for investigating new proteins potentially involved in different aspects of growth factor action in muscle.					1747	150468	8091	5742	1848	122616	5251	54206	26585	79974	963	635	6698	7056	90865	395	5593	23531	7058	2040	51084	10615	11030	81606	2149	858	54443	478	10231	4256	84255	1846	7076	114907	23338	64946	57125	57552	244	822	2152	3554	22974	2059	54438	84890

Troglitazone (TGZ), a member of the thiazolidinedione class of anti-diabetic compounds and a peroxisome proliferator activator receptor-gamma (PPAR-gamma) agonist, restores systemic insulin sensitivity and improves the full insulin resistance syndrome in vivo. The mechanisms underlying its in vivo function are not understood. Here we investigated the potential functional interaction between PPAR-gamma and NF-kappaB in adipocytes. We show that TGZ selectively blocked tumor necrosis factor-alpha-induced and NF-kappaB-dependent repression of multiple adipocyte-specific genes and induction of growth phase and other genes. This occurs without interfering with NF-kappaB expression, activation, nuclear translocation, or DNA binding and without suppressing NF-kappaB-dependent survival signals. Notably, the expressions of some tumor necrosis factor-alpha-induced genes in adipocytes were unaffected by PPAR-gamma activation. In reporter gene assays in HeLa cells, ectopic expression of PPAR-gamma abolished induction of a NF-kappaB-responsive reporter gene by the p65 subunit (RelA) of NF-kappaB, and the inhibition was further enhanced in the presence of TGZ. Conversely, overexpression of p65 inhibited induction of a PPAR-gamma-responsive reporter gene by activated PPAR-gamma in a dose-dependent manner. The inhibitory effect was independent of the presence of NF-kappaB-binding sites in the promoter region. Other NF-kappaB family members, p50 and c-Rel as well as the S276A mutant of p65, blocked PPAR-gamma-mediated gene transcription less effectively. Thus, p65 antagonizes the transcriptional regulatory activity of PPAR-gamma in adipocytes, and PPAR-gamma activation can at least partially override the inhibitory effects of p65 on the expression of key adipocyte genes. Our data suggest that inhibition of NF-kappaB activity is a mechanism by which PPAR-gamma agonists improve insulin sensitivity in vivo and that adipocyte NF-kappaB is a potential therapeutic target for obesity-linked type 2 diabetes.					957	8639	1622	5348	10114	5105	8204	6888	9370	34	10140	346	225	364	7905	10062	3421	949	56729	26994	1306	28996	2180	210	5207	8398	5004	1054	1675	7263	5468	1176	8535	51	9249	1031	6517	63924	9444	7174	6319	10124	211	5997	8800	593	10518	204	4594	83549	729359	10400	9625	4199	3991	8991	1891	50486	35	3417	3099	5827	2819	4056	4023	1050	4837	2194	3910	57678	1376	2171	23344	8694	3655	3295	51655	5091	369	155	10580	79191	183	9054

The activation of muscle-specific gene expression requires the coordinated action of muscle regulatory proteins and chromatin-remodeling enzymes. Microarray analysis performed in the presence or absence of a dominant-negative BRG1 ATPase demonstrated that approximately one-third of MyoD-induced genes were highly dependent on SWI/SNF enzymes. To understand the mechanism of activation, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitations analyzing the myogenin promoter. We found that H4 hyperacetylation preceded Brg1 binding in a MyoD-dependent manner but that MyoD binding occurred subsequent to H4 modification and Brg1 interaction. In the absence of functional SWI/SNF enzymes, muscle regulatory proteins did not bind to the myogenin promoter, thereby providing evidence for SWI/SNF-dependent activator binding. We observed that the homeodomain factor Pbx1, which cooperates with MyoD to stimulate myogenin expression, is constitutively bound to the myogenin promoter in a SWI/SNF-independent manner, suggesting a two-step mechanism in which MyoD initially interacts indirectly with the myogenin promoter and attracts chromatin-remodeling enzymes, which then facilitate direct binding by MyoD and other regulatory proteins.					9262	729614	92305	3158	2207	274	26353	79805	89797	5925	57458	57326	25970	10658	55502	4656	1627	29970	4632	3732	604	55719	132720	7037	11098	55326	11052	3092	51177	8497	3800	58517	3488	688	22849	1073	4654	9653	2997	56899	5577	4608	4621	27295	23627	311	5817	84823	1026	23008	1146	7140	781	1158	10912	487	79885	3481	208	7976	4205	3801	29895	80256	23513	1760	4038	896	23241	79001	3960	476	861	7136	8027	51088	1134	5702	58	79877	388	3270	7125	1140	8291	4635	23277	7139	2027

BRCA1 gene is a tumor suppressor for breast and ovarian cancers with the putative role in DNA repair and transcription. To characterize the role of BRCA1 in transcriptional regulation, we analyzed gene expression profiles of mouse embryonic stem cells deficient in BRCA1 using microarray technology. We found that loss of BRCA1 correlated with decreased expression of several groups of genes including stress response genes, cytoskeleton genes, and genes involved in protein synthesis and degradation. Previous study showed that BRCA1 is a transcriptional co-activator of p53 protein; however the majority of p53 target genes remained at the same expression levels in BRCA1 knockout cells as in the wild type cells. The only p53 target gene down-regulated with the loss of BRCA1 was 14-3-3 sigma, a major G(2)/M checkpoint control gene. Similar to cells with decreased 14-3-3 sigma activity, BRCA1-deficient cells were unable to sustain G(2)/M growth arrest after exposure to ionizing radiation. We find that BRCA1 induction of 14-3-3 sigma requires the presence of wild type p53 and can be regulated by a minimal p53 response element.					6917	8091	375	6118	1739	1152	5701	7473	9444	6016	3301	8027	1653	56925	3320	8663	308	7453	537	2810	59	57062	2923	2260	25819	9982	7846	8650	760	6709	306	1654	5700	7168	9475	1965	2058	3856	3399	70	9188	6876	6301	4747	5178	351	58	7022	7431

DNA microarrays are powerful tools for the analysis of gene expression on a genomic scale. The importance of individual regulatory events for the process under study can however not be deduced unequivocally without additional experiments. We devised a strategy to identify central regulators of cancer drug responses by combining the results of microarray experiments with efficient methods for phenotypic testing of candidate genes. We exposed murine FL5.12 pro-B cells to cisplatin, camptothecin, methotrexate or paclitaxel, respectively and analysed the patterns of gene expression with cDNA microarrays. Drug-specific regulatory events as well as intersections between different apoptotic pathways, including previously studied responses to staurosporine and interleukin-3 (IL-3) deprivation, were identified. Genes shared by at least three pathways were chosen for further analysis. Ectopic expression of three such genes, TEAP, GP49B, and Lipin1 was found to have an anti-proliferative effect on pro-B cells. Interestingly, we identified hemoglobin alpha as a strong pro-apoptotic regulator. While hemoglobin-expressing cells were growing normally in the presence of IL-3, they displayed accelerated apoptosis with similar kinetics as Bax overexpressing cells upon IL-3 removal. The pro-apoptotic effect of hemoglobin was suppressed by Bcl-2 and was characterized by enhanced stimulation of caspase activity.					10628	138162	81671	81607	677	23589	10140	79442	2015	23175	963	9538	1026	84548	7832	57709	5372	900	23731	94241	4193	3039	378938	3983	55766	10906

Elongin A is a transcription elongation factor that increases the overall rate of mRNA chain elongation by RNA polymerase II. To investigate the function of Elongin A in vivo, the two alleles of the Elongin A gene have been disrupted by homologous recombination in murine embryonic stem (ES) cells. The Elongin A-deficient ES cells are viable, but show a slow growth phenotype because they undergo a delayed mitosis. The cDNA microarray and RNase protection assay using the wild-type and Elongin A-deficient ES cells indicate that the expression of only a small subset of genes is affected in the mutant cells. Taken together, our results suggest that Elongin A regulates transcription of a subset but not all of genes and reveal a linkage between Elongin A function and cell cycle progression.					23242	114876	10124	1829	6888	6574	4126	55972	1488	157570	7203	8819	5460	301	348	7037	47	57494	54469	2887	8408	2735	3945	644054	84661	64400	781	3178	3485	2730	10112	55384	5372	9070	159090	84790	4282	701	4131	51268	10810	10165	54823	25945	1731	5683	1993	2944	7200	4605	7163	4904	501	55632	143884	22823	161742	23492	8726	84722	1807	3838	162966	988	51804	64506	22928	3958	8520	388559	1164	3880	51203	55342	80781	226	10376	8450	8745	6653	10551	7337	30968	8453	6192	7050	79830	3925	23286	999	58516	7855	23195	6917	386724	10653	6648	1381	3775	4502	10734	10383	6657	217	171425	1152	2941	203068	4751	2222	898	4678	10365	10146	5292	5935	1001	10007	8087	5727	7022	3159	2803	359787	55740	10969	5990	3720	54331	8115	56902	4072	25920	1535	4489	8347	64087	6790	79603	3481	1364	27338	79960	138199	6627	134218	3832	6696	874	133418	2027	10732	231	7525	29128	3930	8433	1729	55196	7345	8418	6767	1366	8425	6513	1718	143425	11168	387758	1894	9452	94241	773	7805	55907	256643	55536	7153	132625	23204	11315	137886	128	2287	5245	1786	6277	3320	158219	6932	1028	5264	55959	10926	347733	7416	1719	7520	642843	10856	133686	3157	2956	50511	3843	5985	57085	10598	5901	1848	7411	3480	26135	2245	390999

PPAR gamma is an adipocyte-specific nuclear hormone receptor. Agonists of PPAR gamma, such as thiazolidinediones (TZDs), promote adipocyte differentiation and have insulin-sensitizing effects in animals and diabetic patients. Affymetrix oligonucleotide arrays representing 6347 genes were employed to profile the gene expression responses of mature 3T3-L1 adipocytes and differentiating preadipocytes to a TZD PPAR gamma agonist in vitro. The expression of 579 genes was significantly up- or down-regulated by more than 1.5-fold during differentiation and/or by treatment with TZD, and these genes were organized into 32 clusters that demonstrated concerted changes in expression of genes controlling cell growth or lipid metabolism. Quantitative PCR was employed to further characterize gene expression and led to the identification of beta-catenin as a new PPAR gamma target gene. Both mRNA and protein levels for beta-catenin were down-regulated in 3T3-L1 adipocytes compared with fibroblasts and were further decreased by treatment of adipocytes with PPAR gamma agonists. Treatment of db/db mice with a PPAR gamma agonist also resulted in reduction of beta-catenin mRNA levels in adipose tissue. These results suggest that beta-catenin plays an important role in the regulation of adipogenesis. Thus, the transcriptional patterns revealed in this study further the understanding of adipogenesis process and the function of PPAR gamma activation.					3566	5315	3475	3554	975	7057	2619	1490	6347	3491	3688	302	6659	5159	3083	7707	25939	960	3590	1893	10576	7498	8663	203068	11140	4323	306	1052	7127	7058	2621	928	8522	7351	1938	6354	1410	1019	7343	6387	6382	894	50486	5134	10055	1462	3312	1642	231	841	7056	7421	581	2252	22948	8870	637	466	308	7846	5327	3337	2335	595

The functional roles of neutral lipids in the lung are poorly understood. However, blocking cholesteryl ester and triglyceride metabolism in lysosomal acid lipase gene knockout mice (lal-/-) results in severe pathogenic phenotypes in the lung, including massive neutrophil infiltration, foamy macrophage accumulation, unwanted cell growth, and emphysema. To elucidate the mechanism underlining these pathologies, we performed Affymetrix GeneChip microarray analysis of 1-, 3-, and 6-month-old mice and identified aberrant gene expression that progressed with age. Among changed genes, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-12, apoptosis inhibitor 6 (Api-6), erythroblast transformation-specific domain (Ets) transcription factor family member Spi-C, and oncogene MafB were increased 100-, 70-, 40-, and 10-fold, respectively, in lal-/- lungs versus the wild-type lungs. The pathogenic increases of these molecules occurred primarily in alveolar type II epithelial cells. Transcriptional activities of the MMP-12 and Api-6 promoters were stimulated by Spi-C or MafB in respiratory epithelial cells. Treatment with 9-hydroxyoctadecanoic acids and ciglitazone significantly rescued lal-/- pulmonary inflammation and aberrant gene expression. In addition, both compounds as well as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma inhibited MMP-12 and Api-6 promoter activities. These data suggest that inflammation-triggered cell growth and emphysema during lysosomal acid lipase deficiency are partially caused by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma inactivation.					730249	4481	2289	4758	1788	713	968	4317	2173	338339	245972	54	30061	3579	121599	7941	8685	922	79689	51284	712	339	820	51296	54209	4644	5199	4063	1508	2219	8482	7127	10457	4321	2212	93978	3162	26253	58475	6280	6556	719	5996	4327	2213	25980	58533	7402	7850	9518	219972	10261	51744	9935	7503	714	1230	2920	2207

Troglitazone (TGZ), a member of the thiazolidinedione class of anti-diabetic compounds and a peroxisome proliferator activator receptor-gamma (PPAR-gamma) agonist, restores systemic insulin sensitivity and improves the full insulin resistance syndrome in vivo. The mechanisms underlying its in vivo function are not understood. Here we investigated the potential functional interaction between PPAR-gamma and NF-kappaB in adipocytes. We show that TGZ selectively blocked tumor necrosis factor-alpha-induced and NF-kappaB-dependent repression of multiple adipocyte-specific genes and induction of growth phase and other genes. This occurs without interfering with NF-kappaB expression, activation, nuclear translocation, or DNA binding and without suppressing NF-kappaB-dependent survival signals. Notably, the expressions of some tumor necrosis factor-alpha-induced genes in adipocytes were unaffected by PPAR-gamma activation. In reporter gene assays in HeLa cells, ectopic expression of PPAR-gamma abolished induction of a NF-kappaB-responsive reporter gene by the p65 subunit (RelA) of NF-kappaB, and the inhibition was further enhanced in the presence of TGZ. Conversely, overexpression of p65 inhibited induction of a PPAR-gamma-responsive reporter gene by activated PPAR-gamma in a dose-dependent manner. The inhibitory effect was independent of the presence of NF-kappaB-binding sites in the promoter region. Other NF-kappaB family members, p50 and c-Rel as well as the S276A mutant of p65, blocked PPAR-gamma-mediated gene transcription less effectively. Thus, p65 antagonizes the transcriptional regulatory activity of PPAR-gamma in adipocytes, and PPAR-gamma activation can at least partially override the inhibitory effects of p65 on the expression of key adipocyte genes. Our data suggest that inhibition of NF-kappaB activity is a mechanism by which PPAR-gamma agonists improve insulin sensitivity in vivo and that adipocyte NF-kappaB is a potential therapeutic target for obesity-linked type 2 diabetes.					19	6891	4056	3240	5105	63924	1356	3459	3991	51	6772	1306	10114	50848	2633	12	6648

Protein arginine methyltransferases (PRMTs) have been implicated in transcriptional activation and repression, but their role in controlling cell growth and proliferation remains obscure. We have recently shown that PRMT5 can interact with flag-tagged BRG1- and hBRM-based hSWI/SNF chromatin remodelers and that both complexes can specifically methylate histones H3 and H4. Here we report that PRMT5 can be found in association with endogenous hSWI/SNF complexes, which can methylate H3 and H4 N-terminal tails, and show that H3 arginine 8 and H4 arginine 3 are preferred sites of methylation by recombinant and hSWI/SNF-associated PRMT5. To elucidate the role played by PRMT5 in gene regulation, we have established a PRMT5 antisense cell line and determined by microarray analysis that more genes are derepressed when PRMT5 levels are reduced. Among the affected genes, we show that suppressor of tumorigenicity 7 (ST7) and nonmetastatic 23 (NM23) are direct targets of PRMT5-containing BRG1 and hBRM complexes. Furthermore, we demonstrate that expression of ST7 and NM23 is reduced in a cell line that overexpresses PRMT5 and that this decrease in expression correlates with H3R8 methylation, H3K9 deacetylation, and increased transformation of NIH 3T3 cells. These findings suggest that the BRG1- and hBRM-associated PRMT5 regulates cell growth and proliferation by controlling expression of genes involved in tumor suppression.					6939	83874	6400	3001	2626	84656	3872	7056	2167	26471	3491	1268	10140	3934	2837	1152	5816	3552	5232	23040	821	7412	7071	5054	10450	56339	25819	10962	1949

Here we show that the Ets related molecule (ERM) is expressed exclusively within Sertoli cells in the testis and is required for spermatogonial stem cell self-renewal. Mice with targeted disruption of ERM have a loss of maintenance of spermatogonial stem cell self-renewal without a block in normal spermatogenic differentiation and thus have progressive germ-cell depletion and a Sertoli-cell-only syndrome. Microarray analysis of primary Sertoli cells from ERM-deficient mice showed alterations in secreted factors known to regulate the haematopoietic stem cell niche. These results identify a new function for the Ets family transcription factors in spermatogenesis and provide an example of transcriptional control of a vertebrate stem cell niche.					2212	57214	7503	6387	5341	2213	4321	64581	23452	2641	7056	713	10457	411	10620	963	6354	6372	948	3569

Mechanisms regulating self-renewal and cell fate decisions in mammalian stem cells are poorly understood. We determined global gene expression profiles for mouse and human hematopoietic stem cells and other stages of the hematopoietic hierarchy. Murine and human hematopoietic stem cells share a number of expressed gene products, which define key conserved regulatory pathways in this developmental system. Moreover, in the mouse, a portion of the genetic program of hematopoietic stem cells is shared with embryonic and neural stem cells. This overlapping set of gene products represents a molecular signature of stem cells.					129080	2186	324	6014	54764	60558	8479	10270	9782	5638	79581	10198	27095	5317	55614	3843	4281	5136	9774	375759	5578	23054	201299	84296	159963	54928	26054	10103	1791	254956	55914	127733

The molecular mechanisms that regulate cellular differentiation during development and throughout life are complex. It is now recognized that precise patterns of differentially expressed genes ultimately direct a particular cell toward a given lineage and many of these are regulated during the earliest stages of differentiation. Using a microarray-based expression analysis, we have examined gene expression profiles during the first 24 h of 3T3-L1 adipocyte differentiation. RNA was isolated at times 0, 2, 8, 16, and 24 h following stimulation of differentiation and hybridized in duplicate to high density Affymetrix microarray gene chips containing a series of 13,179 cDNA/expressed sequence tag (EST) probe sets. Two hundred and eighty-five cDNA/ESTs were shown to have at least a fivefold change in expression levels during this time course and both hierarchical and self-organizing map clustering analysis was performed to categorize them by expression profiles. Several genes known to be regulated during this time period were confirmed and Western blot analysis of the proteins encoded by some of the identified genes revealed expression profiles similar to their mRNA counterparts. As expected, many of the genes identified have not been examined in such a critical time period during adipogenesis and may well represent novel adipogenic mediators.					9232	9212	790	6240	7153	3925	5905	699	891	126003	358	29127	79095	3014	91687	3843	56915	6279	6590	9833	54443	3835	11065	3838	183	3934	51477	983	79077	128488	890	991	51203	9055	995	1994	7083	2584	6625	244	3161	6426	10112

We have employed microarray technology using RNA from normal 3T3-L1 adipocytes and from 3T3-L1 adipocytes made insulin-resistant by treatment with tumor necrosis factor-alpha to identify a new class of insulin-responsive genes. These genes continued to respond normally to insulin even though the adipocytes themselves were metabolically insulin-resistant, i.e. they displayed a significantly decreased rate of insulin-stimulated glucose uptake. Approximately 12,000 genes/expressed sequence tags (ESTs) were screened. Of these, 40 genes/ESTs were identified that became insulin-resistant as expected (e.g. Socs-3, junB, and matrix metalloproteinase-11). However, 61 genes/ESTs continued to respond normally to insulin. Although some of these genes were previously shown to be regulated by insulin (e.g. Glut-1 and beta3-adrenergic receptor), other novel insulin-sensitive genes were also identified (e.g. Egr-1, epiregulin, Fra-1, and ABCA1). Real-time reverse transcription-PCR analysis confirmed the expression patterns of several of the differentially expressed genes. One gene that remained insulin-sensitive in the insulin-resistant adipocytes is the transcription factor Egr-1. Using an antisense strategy, we show that tissue factor and macrophage colony-stimulating factor, two cardiovascular risk factors, are downstream EGR-1 target genes in the adipocyte. Taken together, these data support the hypothesis that some signaling pathways remain insulin-sensitive in metabolically insulin-resistant adipocytes. These pathways may promote abnormal gene expression in hyperinsulinemic states like obesity and type II diabetes and thus may contribute to pathologies associated with these conditions.					51421	6513	7057	1958	22822	25819	84617	9592	10678	8871	83931	9021	10528	56342	121053	200734	80176	9536	51602	1959	6347	3162	1848	3156	1039	6354	8061	8553	7280	140809	84549	2069	81894	705

Insulin and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) act through highly homologous receptors that engage similar intracellular signaling pathways, yet these hormones serve largely distinct physiological roles in the control of metabolism and growth, respectively. In an attempt to uncover the molecular mechanisms underlying their divergent functions, we compared insulin receptor (IR) and IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R) regulation of gene expression by microarray analysis, using 3T3-L1 cells expressing either TrkC/IR or TrkC/IGF-1R chimeric receptors to ensure the highly selective activation of each receptor tyrosine kinase. Following stimulation of the chimeric receptors for 4 h, we detected 11 genes to be differentially regulated, of which 10 were up-regulated to a greater extent by the IGF-1R. These included genes involved in adhesion, transcription, transport, and proliferation. The expression of mRNA encoding heparin-binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor (HB-EGF), a potent mitogen, was markedly increased by IGF-1R but not IR activation. This effect was dependent on MAPK, but not phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and did not require an autocrine loop through the epidermal growth factor receptor. HB-EGF mitogenic activity was detectable in the medium of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes expressing activated IGF-1R but not IR, indicating that the transcriptional response is accompanied by a parallel increase in mature HB-EGF protein. The differential abilities of the IR and IGF-1R tyrosine kinases to stimulate the synthesis and release of a growth factor may provide, at least in part, an explanation for the greater role of the IGF-1R in the control of cellular proliferation.					27230	10171	55052	9100	79084	6484	646	10528	3308	26354	29925	9188	64388	27346	6427	23603	10123	140809	6347	6480	11047	10969	4830

DNA microarrays are powerful tools for the analysis of gene expression on a genomic scale. The importance of individual regulatory events for the process under study can however not be deduced unequivocally without additional experiments. We devised a strategy to identify central regulators of cancer drug responses by combining the results of microarray experiments with efficient methods for phenotypic testing of candidate genes. We exposed murine FL5.12 pro-B cells to cisplatin, camptothecin, methotrexate or paclitaxel, respectively and analysed the patterns of gene expression with cDNA microarrays. Drug-specific regulatory events as well as intersections between different apoptotic pathways, including previously studied responses to staurosporine and interleukin-3 (IL-3) deprivation, were identified. Genes shared by at least three pathways were chosen for further analysis. Ectopic expression of three such genes, TEAP, GP49B, and Lipin1 was found to have an anti-proliferative effect on pro-B cells. Interestingly, we identified hemoglobin alpha as a strong pro-apoptotic regulator. While hemoglobin-expressing cells were growing normally in the presence of IL-3, they displayed accelerated apoptosis with similar kinetics as Bax overexpressing cells upon IL-3 removal. The pro-apoptotic effect of hemoglobin was suppressed by Bcl-2 and was characterized by enhanced stimulation of caspase activity.					677	23731	94241	1026	23589	10140	81607	10906	79442	7832	963	900	134492	57709	10628	9538	23175	2887	55766	715	875	5372	138162	84548	8408	29950	1200	81566

The c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs) are encoded by three genes that yield 10 isoforms through alternative mRNA splicing. The roles of each JNK isoform in the many putative biological responses where the JNK pathway is activated are still unclear. To examine the cellular responses mediated by different JNK isoforms, gain-of-function JNK1 polypeptides were generated by fusing the upstream mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase, MKK7, with p46JNK1alpha or p46JNK1beta. The MKK7-JNK fusion proteins, which exhibited constitutive activity in 293T cells, were stably expressed in Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts using retrovirus-mediated gene transfer. Swiss 3T3 cells expressing either of the MKK7-JNK polypeptides were equally sensitized to induction of cell death following serum withdrawal. To search for other cellular responses that may be selectively regulated by the JNK1 isoforms, the gene expression profiles of Swiss 3T3 cells expressing MKK7-JNK1alpha or MKK7-JNK1beta were compared with empty vector-transfected control cells. Affymetrix Genechips identified 46 genes for which expression was increased in MKK7-JNK-expressing cells relative to vector control cells. Twenty genes including those for c-Jun, MKP-7, interluekin-1 receptor family member ST2L/ST2, and c-Jun-binding protein were induced similarly by MKK7-JNK1alpha and MKK7-JNK1beta proteins, whereas 13 genes were selectively increased by MKK7-JNK1alpha and 13 genes were selectively increased by MKK7-JNK1beta. The set of genes selectively induced by MKK7-JNK1beta included a number of known interferon-stimulated genes (ISG12, ISG15, IGTP, and GTPI). Consistent with these gene expression changes, Swiss 3T3 cells expressing MKK7-JNK1beta exhibited increased resistance to vesicular stomatitis virus-induced cell death. These findings reveal evidence for JNK isoform-selective gene regulation and support a role for distinct JNK isoforms in specific cellular responses.					6446	3725	894	27086	6352	10447	1805	3398	80381	6659	80824	9636	3437	3434	10379	115361	1843	83982	7045	55364	11274	6474	9173	23452	1501	9246	3491	861	1948	10188	7114	3371	3627	4015	4124

DeltaFosB (a truncated form of FosB) and CREB (cAMP response element binding protein) are transcription factors induced in the brain's reward pathways after chronic exposure to drugs of abuse. However, their mechanisms of action and the genes they regulate remain unclear. Using microarray analysis in the nucleus accumbens of inducible transgenic mice, we found that CREB and a dominant-negative CREB have opposite effects on gene expression, as do prolonged expression of DeltaFosB and the activator protein-1 (AP-1) antagonist DeltacJun. However, unlike CREB, short-term and prolonged DeltaFosB induction had opposing effects on gene expression. Gene expression induced by short-term DeltaFosB and by CREB was strikingly similar, and both reduced the rewarding effects of cocaine, whereas prolonged DeltaFosB expression increased drug reward. Gene expression after a short cocaine treatment was more dependent on CREB, whereas gene expression after a longer cocaine treatment became increasingly DeltaFosB dependent. These findings help define the molecular functions of CREB and DeltaFosB and identify clusters of genes that contribute to cocaine addiction.					4208	10975	586	3925	1734	148808	51760	5218	5274	60682	4000	382	104	10447	90410	55353	64781	5898	3096	5358	57446	63974	7071	158219	10381	114876	51523	2554	4325	6752	627	11075	55294	10439	10098	10169	2173	51144	2782	10409	2353	11167	138151	6456	10716	4267	4856	361	4761	4336	2101	3398	6324	57568	9118	4717	79629	3422	50861	389075	5789	1490	4259	8618	6855	116	885	7277	57007	7223	3005	4741	127833	10815	4852	8482	1012	9689	152217	6750	9070	549	5730	10487	7025	1993	2257	8777	6804	7404	51522	51084	58476	112	54958	3304	79095	11332	97	10539

The insulin/IGF-1 (insulin-like growth factor 1) signalling pathway promotes adipocyte differentiation via complex signalling networks. Here, using microarray analysis of brown preadipocytes that are derived from wild-type and insulin receptor substrate (Irs) knockout animals that exhibit progressively impaired differentiation, we define 374 genes/expressed-sequence tags whose expression in preadipocytes correlates with the ultimate ability of the cells to differentiate. Many of these genes, including preadipocyte factor-1 (Pref-1) and multiple members of the Wnt signalling pathway, are related to early adipogenic events. Necdin is also markedly increased in Irs knockout cells that cannot differentiate, and knockdown of necdin restores brown adipogenesis with downregulation of Pref-1 and Wnt10a expression. Insulin receptor substrate proteins regulate a necdin-E2F4 interaction that represses peroxisome-proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) transcription via a cyclic AMP response element binding protein (CREB)-dependent pathway. Together these define a key signalling network that is involved in brown preadipocyte determination.					967	79089	4635	9563	55565	4128	3487	3142	3572	27122	104	8241	7447	10106	2687	827	2326	8910	7067	6495	6423	2052	51250	7090	5493	5893	6450	64208	5077	3827	8639	1902	1031	26240	94031	134147	2051	3708	3698	10266	6641	7580	5371	27244	1293	133	70	51112	7139	2745	9723	6591	835	1291	23410	23184	8613	84124	4801	3281	5167	1947	1153	2184	9283	1601	6302	91543	4259	55704	51170	83752	9516	22998	2697	2101	10758	93621	51552	9367	3977	23258	2620	8745	1471	7135	822	1729	8848	23217	3554	390816	8829	463	55832	3082	9470	419	29895	28970	5256	7140	5865	4323	79158	7056	8706	2167	1282	4828	8395	7148	6611	7045	8404	4091	55076	8030	958	10156	7134	23589	122786	4632	1284	253738	2952	2495	3052	6892	8209	7105	1281	1397	27069
MCCLUNG_COCAIN_REWARD_4WK	M1600		14566342	McClung CA,Nestler EJ		Table 12			SEQ_ACCESSION	John Newman	University of Washington	Genes up-regulated in the nucleus accumbens (a major reward center in the brain) after 4 weeks of cocaine [PubChem=5760] treatment.	DeltaFosB (a truncated form of FosB) and CREB (cAMP response element binding protein) are transcription factors induced in the brain's reward pathways after chronic exposure to drugs of abuse. However, their mechanisms of action and the genes they regulate remain unclear. Using microarray analysis in the nucleus accumbens of inducible transgenic mice, we found that CREB and a dominant-negative CREB have opposite effects on gene expression, as do prolonged expression of DeltaFosB and the activator protein-1 (AP-1) antagonist DeltacJun. However, unlike CREB, short-term and prolonged DeltaFosB induction had opposing effects on gene expression. Gene expression induced by short-term DeltaFosB and by CREB was strikingly similar, and both reduced the rewarding effects of cocaine, whereas prolonged DeltaFosB expression increased drug reward. Gene expression after a short cocaine treatment was more dependent on CREB, whereas gene expression after a longer cocaine treatment became increasingly DeltaFosB dependent. These findings help define the molecular functions of CREB and DeltaFosB and identify clusters of genes that contribute to cocaine addiction.					3562	8566	81929	23169	1300	23075	6954	827	22944	6929	1843	10914	10121	9314	10391	4773	79415	84747	126669	1418	7071	84624	9937	717	3164	65125	6597	6318	6975	158521	8030	80331	10270	2694	819	2353	1195	350	51647	100	7189	688	5905	1073	3709	5055	5170	1295	3626	10699	27161	815	23413	55000	5187	23411	8733	5033	3337	7535	2980	5087	57169	3605	640	1848	54882	2035	7358	23095	7850	6664	4753	51203	10157

Cytosine methylation of mammalian DNA is essential for the proper epigenetic regulation of gene expression and maintenance of genomic integrity. To define the mechanism through which demethylated cells die, and to establish a paradigm for identifying genes regulated by DNA methylation, we have generated mice with a conditional allele for the maintenance DNA methyltransferase gene Dnmt1. Cre-mediated deletion of Dnmt1 causes demethylation of cultured fibroblasts and a uniform p53-dependent cell death. Mutational inactivation of Trp53 partially rescues the demethylated fibroblasts for up to five population doublings in culture. Oligonucleotide microarray analysis showed that up to 10% of genes are aberrantly expressed in demethylated fibroblasts. Our results demonstrate that loss of Dnmt1 causes cell-type-specific changes in gene expression that impinge on several pathways, including expression of imprinted genes, cell-cycle control, growth factor/receptor signal transduction and mobilization of retroelements.					3459	9636	1410	1969	9618	1499	1111	142	3717	25942	1571	573	3489	5154	2965	2260	1894	6422	1026	274	7905	1435	10544	993	5743	3159	5430	5970	2919	6004	7538	3627	4599	2022	191	3315	2835	123	8661	3665	3726	6590	5610	1618	1445	7706	57007	7083	22822	6347	6118	3135	7503	10808	4780	5606	901	7058	5893	3491	7251	10512	7187	3556	3437	2069	2624	9314	2118	10155	7884	10153	3434	3091	9021	3588	4361

We have analyzed the developmental molecular programs of the mouse hippocampus, a cortical structure critical for learning and memory, by means of large-scale DNA microarray techniques. Of 11,000 genes and expressed sequence tags examined, 1,926 showed dynamic changes during hippocampal development from embryonic day 16 to postnatal day 30. Gene-cluster analysis was used to group these genes into 16 distinct clusters with striking patterns that appear to correlate with major developmental hallmarks and cellular events. These include genes involved in neuronal proliferation, differentiation, and synapse formation.

During cellular differentiation and development, it is recognized that many complex molecular mechanisms as well as precise patterns of differentially expressed genes occur in directing precursor cells toward a given lineage. Using microarray-based technology, we examined gene expression across the course of 3T3-L1 adipocyte differentiation. Total cellular RNA was isolated at times 0, 2, 8, 16, 24, 48, and 96 h following treatment with either standard hormonal inducers of differentiation; insulin, dexamethasone, isobutylmethylxanthine (IDX), or IDX plus trichostatin A (TsA), a histone deacetylase inhibitor and potent adipogenic inhibitor. cRNA was synthesized from cellular RNA and hybridized to high density Affymetrix MG_U74Av2 microarray gene chips containing 12,488 cDNA/Expressed Sequence Tags (ESTs) probe sets. From the IDX-only treated cells, all probe sets that were either unchanged or differentially expressed less than 2-fold throughout differentiation with respect to time 0 preadipocytes were excluded from further analyses. This selection resulted in a net of 1686 transcripts, 859 were increased in expression, and 827 were decreased in expression at least 2-fold across differentiation. To focus in on genes that were more specific to differentiation, the same analysis was performed on IDX plus TsA-treated non-differentiating cells and all probe sets from the IDX-only group that exhibited similar expression profiles in the non-differentiating TsA-treated group were excluded leaving a total of 1016 transcripts that were regulated only under differentiating conditions. Six hundred and thirty-six of these transcripts were elevated at least 2-fold and 380 exhibited a decrease in expression relative to time 0 preadipocytes. This group of genes was further analyzed using hierarchical clustering and self-organizing maps and resulted in the identification of numerous genes not previously known to be regulated during adipocyte differentiation. Many of these genes may well represent novel adipogenic mediators and markers of adipogenesis.					2752	56942	10328	3939	1291	6627	1284	28969	55651	80781	186	955	10061	3014	58480	4839	54888	79602	5519	3487	5496	2050	1967	51129	10171	1434	27258	3419	283120	1292	2618	244	51123	7704	51377	2288	6484	317781	1800	64781	604	25946	23089	25987	6183	23129	6720	7203

Peptide growth factors regulate cell fate by activating distinct signal transduction pathways that ultimately influence gene expression. Insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) play central roles in controlling somatic growth and participate in skeletal muscle development and regeneration. In cultured muscle cells, IGF action is critical both for maintaining viability during the transition from proliferating to differentiating myoblasts and for facilitating differentiation. By contrast, platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) can sustain cell survival but inhibits differentiation. Here we examine the genetic programs that accompany IGF and PDGF action in myoblasts. Through analysis of high-density oligonucleotide arrays containing approximately 36,000 mouse probe sets, we identify 90 transcripts differentially induced by IGF-I, including 28 muscle-specific genes and 33 previously unannotated mRNAs, and 55 transcripts specifically stimulated by PDGF, including 14 unknowns. Detailed study of one IGF-induced mRNA shows that it encodes a protein related to a recently characterized repulsive guidance molecule postulated to regulate neuronal targeting during development. Our results demonstrate the power of transcriptional profiling for gene discovery and provide opportunities for investigating new proteins potentially involved in different aspects of growth factor action in muscle.					5569	6525	29895	10472	8436	84706	4635	55740	79879	9172	79041	6261	7140	30812	2628	4632	252995	4608	6442	7138	5563	89	79661	1268	51439	1339	53632	5925	487	28971	165904	2065	4684	2326	389827	6445	25849	130827	25900	7168	283807	255743	70	10468	79885	79933	1158	92235	4621	7169	7855	80336	26548	23676	11155	7273	146862	493	7125	150572	3481	115290	7134	5224	54014	340156	1644	131377	8497	9201	5837	3316	58	10324	442721	23500	7139	7135	6345	4656	9099	148738

Ageing of the brain leads to impairments in cognitive and motor skills, and is the major risk factor for several common neurological disorders such as Alzheimer disease (AD) and Parkinson disease (PD). Recent studies suggest that normal brain ageing is associated with subtle morphological and functional alterations in specific neuronal circuits, as opposed to large-scale neuronal loss. In fact, ageing of the central nervous system in diverse mammalian species shares many features, such as atrophy of pyramidal neurons, synaptic atrophy, decrease of striatal dopamine receptors, accumulation of fluorescent pigments, cytoskeletal abnormalities, and reactive astrocytes and microglia. To provide the first global analysis of brain ageing at the molecular level, we used oligonucleotide arrays representing 6,347 genes to determine the gene-expression profile of the ageing neocortex and cerebellum in mice. Ageing resulted in a gene-expression profile indicative of an inflammatory response, oxidative stress and reduced neurotrophic support in both brain regions. At the transcriptional level, brain ageing in mice displays parallels with human neurodegenerative disorders. Caloric restriction, which retards the ageing process in mammals, selectively attenuated the age-associated induction of genes encoding inflammatory and stress responses.					84823	3014	1906	8456	241	783	47	1588	7068	3376	25932	5936	7037	4669	2321	6778	5436	1915	6500	3798	59269	6732	24148	7407	3315	1938	3006	6897	3799	8940	1119	5912	3605	7704	10112	2902	2592	2526	5879	5970	866	28974	1019	7791	54331	488	808	7508	3439	51043	515	5261	1936	1849	338	9184	4437	1576	3691	5106	3460	5784	1495	346	7417	442338	5058	2058	6535	4192	5232	8239	4921	4762	4780	1132	3549	5371	347733	5067	1282	10484	55970	7855	1965	3756	1973	51174
CUI_TCF21_TARGETS_2_UP	M1610		16207825	Cui S,Li C,Ema M,Weinstein J,Quaggin SE		Appendix 1B			Mouse430_2	John Newman	University of Washington	All significantly up-regulated genes in kidney glomeruli isolated from TCF21 [Gene ID=6943] knockout mice.	Mouse mutations have provided tremendous insights into the molecular basis of renal and glomerular development. However, genes often play important roles during multiple stages of nephrogenesis, making it difficult to determine the role of a gene in a specific cell lineage such as the podocyte. Conditional gene targeting and chimeric analysis are two possible approaches to dissect the function of genes in specific cell populations. However, these are labor-intensive and costly and require the generation, validation, and analysis of additional transgenic lines. For overcoming these shortcomings and, specifically, for studying the role of gene function in developing glomeruli, a technique to isolate and purify glomeruli from murine embryos was developed. Combined with gene expression profiling, this method was used to identify differentially expressed genes in glomeruli from Pod1 knockout (KO) mice that die in the perinatal period with multiple renal defects. Glomeruli from early developing stages (late S-shape/early capillary loop) onward can be isolated successfully from wild-type and KO kidneys at 18.5 d postcoitus, and RNA can readily be obtained and used for genome-wide microarray analysis. With this approach, 3986 genes that are differently expressed between glomeruli from Pod1 KO and wild-type mice were identified, including a four-fold reduction of alpha 8 integrin mRNA in glomeruli from Pod1 KO mice that was confirmed by immunostaining. This procedure may be adapted to any transgenic strain, providing a rapid and efficient method to dissect the function of specific genes in glomerular development.					6320	8574	23426	83743	3956	64084	8091	9133	23347	388581	92369	411	147841	84135	1909	115399	92312	26227	9420	7586	7026	6664	2987	7479	54478	57178	7515	5425	2191	9148	4060	4282	27258	894	89891	78989	1191	2099	81539	54796	5176	4001	29994	84957	10465	57535	56256	2953	10460	2697	83667	2217	983	388228	388815	148223	3856	9353	54496	653	58480	9108	5764	140707	3216	7867	79583	762	8099	322	7083	367	80312	9232	728392	4713	1841	83540	108	64943	2627	4684	7064	6502	441151	8508	9670	5730	6415	7920	5947	26472	8572	1163	5621	375616	1277	8828	83461	55203	5902	10278	10512	56853	55384	3910	23224	343450	201161	9620	79805	6612	2335	9455	23640	4256	6345	222234	9735	1281	5050	79602	1296	59272	85407	55748	11065	3070	727936	9074	995	3485	5154	80319	2043	30811	256126	388564	23007	83879	6542	65263	6628	3671	440193	2621	6715	5464	688	2584	10631	5300	3108	1545	3479	64284	11340	93185	2288	9094	10406	60681	3149	25891	7130	55011	138311	4174	7045	259266	25864	6171	83463	55657	3075	7365	5179	7043	280636	2318	23414	79867	54361	8463	4237	7001	4774	27315	132884	2892	10534	10436	80381	201254	4784	8835	25981	10399	8645	55536	6136	93664	56852	55210	8208	4211	79877	5211	1462	4776	28992	9700	57662	55732	25849	23234	151887	7052	1291	29781	641	827	10418	150465	64097	54972	55192	51154	6646	5649	328	155382	4325	3619	84153	56915	9080	26517	79885	81620	51599	3752	471	51678	121268	113130	5245	79077	56942	129080	652	8243	10736	84256	5832	9687	4320	4867	3161	8815	10042	54107	90417	127700	79050	4267	9509	4128	130576	2138	120	9201	4172	57699	8840	28969	10516	10328	64838	57060	4176	6944	22974	23107	126353	54795	2395	10809	790	29968	4192	4440	5557	729967	84707	5036	2743	51514	340348	4613	9892	221150	1893	56342	129138	221883	25906	23705	3835	29089	27346	78999	23076	3908	1634	84553	55355	1080	80728	6449	129804	55143	4046	186	147495	6508	50854	124540	64105	5100	120114	5983	9793	23468	9060	91419	1535	2331	90161	90865	10236	353	146713	26575	974	1004	115908	10184	283431	84168	56265	1311	91653	5888	26037	1027	7849	55329	4234	284023	23397	80144	81502	8914	25936	84451	3192	8214	6839	79075	349633	28959	55268	79090	666	10882	8318	3875	80070	7412	128239	5831	3921	51042	9413	5360	25804	477	57333	9718	6625	5575	605	3929	890	6692	2737	1058	9588	5101	83451	4830	10629	29098	5424	644353	10082	168667	55920	1181	8406	6203	6297	150084	5064	2119	65005	1292	84247	126133	51542	4147	57722	6723	3925	57555	29799	60

NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase (CPR) is an essential component for the function of many enzymes, including microsomal cytochrome P450 (P450) monooxygenases and heme oxygenases. In liver-Cpr-null (with liver-specific Cpr deletion) and Cpr-low (with reduced CPR expression in all organs examined) mouse models, a reduced serum cholesterol level and an induction of hepatic P450s were observed, whereas hepatomegaly and fatty liver were only observed in the liver-Cpr-null model. Our goal was to identify hepatic gene expression changes related to these phenotypes. Cpr-lox mice (with a floxed Cpr gene and normal CPR expression) were used as the control. Through microarray analysis, we identified many genes that were differentially expressed among the three groups of mice. We also recognized the 12 gene ontology terms that contained the most significantly changed gene expression in at least one of the two mouse models. We further uncovered potential mechanisms, such as an increased activation of constitutive androstane receptor and a decreased activation of peroxisomal proliferator-activated receptor-alpha by precursors of cholesterol biosynthesis, that underlie common changes (e.g. induction of multiple P450s and suppression of genes for fatty acid metabolism) in response to CPR loss in the two mouse models. Additionally, we observed model-specific gene expression changes, such as the induction of a fatty-acid translocase (Cd36 antigen) and the suppression of carnitine O-palmitoyltransferase 1 (Cpt1a) and acyl-CoA synthetase long chain family member 1 (Acsl1), that are potentially responsible for the severe hepatic lipidosis and an altered fatty acid profile observed in liver-Cpr-null mice.					1562	1717	80777	6920	1581	2946	2947	3157	1555	6319	6307	2645	2224	2940	1595	23474	343	6713	3422	2939

We used Affymetrix microarrays to detect gene expression changes in mouse lymphoma (L5178Y) and human lymphoblastoid (TK6) cells in response to methyl methanesulfonate (MMS; a prototypical alkylating agent) and bleomycin (a prototypical oxidative mutagen). Cells were treated for 4 hr, and RNA was isolated either at the end of the treatment or after a 20-hr recovery period. Two concentrations of each agent were used based on cytotoxicity levels and Tk mutant frequencies. Our microarray data analysis indicated that MMS and bleomycin gene expression responses were considerably different in mouse cells versus human cells. The results also suggested that more comprehensive cellular responses to MMS and bleomycin occurred in TK6 cells than in L5178Y cells. In contrast to L5178Y cells, the response of TK6 cells to MMS and bleomycin was characterized by the induction of p53-dependent genes that are involved in DNA repair, cell cycle regulation, and apoptosis. It appears that the induction of DNA damage by MMS in human TK6 cells mediated cytotoxicity and led to decreased cell survival. This may explain the greater sensitivity of TK6 cells to cytotoxic effects of MMS compared to L5178Y cells. Bleomycin exerted comparable cytotoxic effects in the two cell lines. Overall, these studies were unable to identify distinctive gene expression changes that differentiated bleomycin from MMS in either TK6 cells or mouse lymphoma cells.					9086	5930	1728	5955	2011	10434	5931	71	9039	5573	3149	10857	9791	60674	22931	1974	7852	6670	25819	1633	523	5684	7296	9987	2237	990	7411	9525	6241	57162	10927	9304	10733	1528	7494	8543

Diminished activity of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARgamma) may play a role in the pathogenesis of hypertension and vascular dysfunction. To better understand what genes are regulated by PPARgamma, an experimental data set was generated by microarray analysis, in duplicate, of pooled aortic mRNA isolated from mice treated for 21 days with a PPARgamma agonist (rosiglitazone) or vehicle. Of the 12,488 probe sets present on the array (Affymetrix MG-U74Av2), 181 were differentially expressed between groups according to a statistical metric generated using Affymetrix software. A significant correlation was observed between the microarray results and real-time RT-PCR analysis of 39 of these genes. Cluster analysis revealed 3 expression patterns, 29 transcripts of moderate abundance that were decreased (-93%) to very low levels, 106 transcripts that were downregulated (-42%), and 46 transcripts that were upregulated (+70%). Functional groups that were decreased included inflammatory response (-93%, n = 6), immune response (-86%, n = 7), and cytokines (-82%, n = 7). There was an overall upregulation in the oxidoreductase activity group (+47%, n = 9). Individually, six transcripts in this group were increased (+72%), and three were decreased (-34%).

An enriched environment is known to promote structural changes in the brain and to enhance learning and memory performance in rodents [Hebb, D. O. (1947) Am. Psychol. 2, 306-307]. To better understand the molecular mechanisms underlying these experience-dependent cognitive changes, we have used high-density oligonucleotide microarrays to analyze gene expression in the brain. Expression of a large number of genes changes in response to enrichment training, many of which can be linked to neuronal structure, synaptic plasticity, and transmission. A number of these genes may play important roles in modulating learning and memory capacity.					8491	4670	387	3309	7706	8076	6863	1912	1173	5730	9874	808	4236	6844	1786

We have employed microarray technology using RNA from normal 3T3-L1 adipocytes and from 3T3-L1 adipocytes made insulin-resistant by treatment with tumor necrosis factor-alpha to identify a new class of insulin-responsive genes. These genes continued to respond normally to insulin even though the adipocytes themselves were metabolically insulin-resistant, i.e. they displayed a significantly decreased rate of insulin-stimulated glucose uptake. Approximately 12,000 genes/expressed sequence tags (ESTs) were screened. Of these, 40 genes/ESTs were identified that became insulin-resistant as expected (e.g. Socs-3, junB, and matrix metalloproteinase-11). However, 61 genes/ESTs continued to respond normally to insulin. Although some of these genes were previously shown to be regulated by insulin (e.g. Glut-1 and beta3-adrenergic receptor), other novel insulin-sensitive genes were also identified (e.g. Egr-1, epiregulin, Fra-1, and ABCA1). Real-time reverse transcription-PCR analysis confirmed the expression patterns of several of the differentially expressed genes. One gene that remained insulin-sensitive in the insulin-resistant adipocytes is the transcription factor Egr-1. Using an antisense strategy, we show that tissue factor and macrophage colony-stimulating factor, two cardiovascular risk factors, are downstream EGR-1 target genes in the adipocyte. Taken together, these data support the hypothesis that some signaling pathways remain insulin-sensitive in metabolically insulin-resistant adipocytes. These pathways may promote abnormal gene expression in hyperinsulinemic states like obesity and type II diabetes and thus may contribute to pathologies associated with these conditions.					5166	90	4320	1027	9709	5916	55756	7328	5900	1628	983	27244	473	112869	8777	57761	1647	26471

Malignant transformation of mouse skin by chemical carcinogens and tumour promoters, such as the phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), is a multistage process that leads to squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) formation. In an effort to identify tumour-associated genes, we studied the influence of short-term TPA-treatment on the gene expression profile of murine skin. A comprehensive microarray with some 5,000 murine gene specific cDNA fragments was established and hybridised with pooled RNA derived from control and TPA-treated dorsal skin samples. Of these genes, 54 were up- and 35 were down-regulated upon TPA application. Additionally, we performed suppression subtractive hybridisation (SSH) with respective RNA pools to generate and analyse a cDNA library enriched for TPA-inducible genes. Expression data of selected genes were confirmed by quantitative real-time PCR and Northern blot analysis. Comparison of microarray and SSH data revealed that 26% of up-regulated genes identified by expression profiling matched with those present in the SSH library. Besides numerous known genes, we identified a large set of unknown cDNAs that represent previously unrecognised TPA-regulated genes in murine skin with potential function in tumour promotion. Additionally, some TPA-induced genes, such as Sprr1A, Saa3, JunB, Il4ralpha, Gp38, RalGDS and Slpi exhibit high basal level in advanced stages of skin carcinogenesis, suggesting that at least a subgroup of the identified TPA-regulated genes may contribute to tumour progression and metastasis.					2896	4632	26057	2875	390213	7709	6366	7069	79140	57035	341	10522	54587	10850	55026	1278	9445	919	8557	4190	54477	2027	1277	165	56904	3204	6678	23205	2766

The activation of muscle-specific gene expression requires the coordinated action of muscle regulatory proteins and chromatin-remodeling enzymes. Microarray analysis performed in the presence or absence of a dominant-negative BRG1 ATPase demonstrated that approximately one-third of MyoD-induced genes were highly dependent on SWI/SNF enzymes. To understand the mechanism of activation, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitations analyzing the myogenin promoter. We found that H4 hyperacetylation preceded Brg1 binding in a MyoD-dependent manner but that MyoD binding occurred subsequent to H4 modification and Brg1 interaction. In the absence of functional SWI/SNF enzymes, muscle regulatory proteins did not bind to the myogenin promoter, thereby providing evidence for SWI/SNF-dependent activator binding. We observed that the homeodomain factor Pbx1, which cooperates with MyoD to stimulate myogenin expression, is constitutively bound to the myogenin promoter in a SWI/SNF-independent manner, suggesting a two-step mechanism in which MyoD initially interacts indirectly with the myogenin promoter and attracts chromatin-remodeling enzymes, which then facilitate direct binding by MyoD and other regulatory proteins.					58	7125	4621	4635	274	7139	7136	3488	7140	4656	29895

DNA microarrays are powerful tools for the analysis of gene expression on a genomic scale. The importance of individual regulatory events for the process under study can however not be deduced unequivocally without additional experiments. We devised a strategy to identify central regulators of cancer drug responses by combining the results of microarray experiments with efficient methods for phenotypic testing of candidate genes. We exposed murine FL5.12 pro-B cells to cisplatin, camptothecin, methotrexate or paclitaxel, respectively and analysed the patterns of gene expression with cDNA microarrays. Drug-specific regulatory events as well as intersections between different apoptotic pathways, including previously studied responses to staurosporine and interleukin-3 (IL-3) deprivation, were identified. Genes shared by at least three pathways were chosen for further analysis. Ectopic expression of three such genes, TEAP, GP49B, and Lipin1 was found to have an anti-proliferative effect on pro-B cells. Interestingly, we identified hemoglobin alpha as a strong pro-apoptotic regulator. While hemoglobin-expressing cells were growing normally in the presence of IL-3, they displayed accelerated apoptosis with similar kinetics as Bax overexpressing cells upon IL-3 removal. The pro-apoptotic effect of hemoglobin was suppressed by Bcl-2 and was characterized by enhanced stimulation of caspase activity.					10410	375757	6251	51316	9694	81611	5954	6741	572	25994	23344	51501	6576	2023	57153	292	10581	665	5478	596	2027	79585	205	5165	2287	4253	26578	6122	203068	29968	8887	3925	4602	983	578	6776	307	689	3157	56985	54440	4493	2597	2821	226	4731

The molecular mechanisms that regulate cellular differentiation during development and throughout life are complex. It is now recognized that precise patterns of differentially expressed genes ultimately direct a particular cell toward a given lineage and many of these are regulated during the earliest stages of differentiation. Using a microarray-based expression analysis, we have examined gene expression profiles during the first 24 h of 3T3-L1 adipocyte differentiation. RNA was isolated at times 0, 2, 8, 16, and 24 h following stimulation of differentiation and hybridized in duplicate to high density Affymetrix microarray gene chips containing a series of 13,179 cDNA/expressed sequence tag (EST) probe sets. Two hundred and eighty-five cDNA/ESTs were shown to have at least a fivefold change in expression levels during this time course and both hierarchical and self-organizing map clustering analysis was performed to categorize them by expression profiles. Several genes known to be regulated during this time period were confirmed and Western blot analysis of the proteins encoded by some of the identified genes revealed expression profiles similar to their mRNA counterparts. As expected, many of the genes identified have not been examined in such a critical time period during adipogenesis and may well represent novel adipogenic mediators.					2535	4856	3135	3479	51706	1601	57761	5272	5327	91860	7043	50807	7094	4969	5900	6423	54518	4134	862	7424	3417	9315	10608	1435	2277	1295	9636	59	2152	7058	1647	283131	10211	6696	5699	65997	6652	2620	4023	10169	26056	2184	1649	4256	2619	10398	1410	7168	1513	5159	123	4082	7078	9246	5106	901	126	1301	5096	5156	166	10365	8260

Cytosine methylation of mammalian DNA is essential for the proper epigenetic regulation of gene expression and maintenance of genomic integrity. To define the mechanism through which demethylated cells die, and to establish a paradigm for identifying genes regulated by DNA methylation, we have generated mice with a conditional allele for the maintenance DNA methyltransferase gene Dnmt1. Cre-mediated deletion of Dnmt1 causes demethylation of cultured fibroblasts and a uniform p53-dependent cell death. Mutational inactivation of Trp53 partially rescues the demethylated fibroblasts for up to five population doublings in culture. Oligonucleotide microarray analysis showed that up to 10% of genes are aberrantly expressed in demethylated fibroblasts. Our results demonstrate that loss of Dnmt1 causes cell-type-specific changes in gene expression that impinge on several pathways, including expression of imprinted genes, cell-cycle control, growth factor/receptor signal transduction and mobilization of retroelements.					2706	3949	1381	1297	3481	3257	3728	5424	1292	283120	3146	2620	11338	2887	1301	8325	1786	1163	1058	1291	5178	1947	4191	6319	1289

During cellular differentiation and development, it is recognized that many complex molecular mechanisms as well as precise patterns of differentially expressed genes occur in directing precursor cells toward a given lineage. Using microarray-based technology, we examined gene expression across the course of 3T3-L1 adipocyte differentiation. Total cellular RNA was isolated at times 0, 2, 8, 16, 24, 48, and 96 h following treatment with either standard hormonal inducers of differentiation; insulin, dexamethasone, isobutylmethylxanthine (IDX), or IDX plus trichostatin A (TsA), a histone deacetylase inhibitor and potent adipogenic inhibitor. cRNA was synthesized from cellular RNA and hybridized to high density Affymetrix MG_U74Av2 microarray gene chips containing 12,488 cDNA/Expressed Sequence Tags (ESTs) probe sets. From the IDX-only treated cells, all probe sets that were either unchanged or differentially expressed less than 2-fold throughout differentiation with respect to time 0 preadipocytes were excluded from further analyses. This selection resulted in a net of 1686 transcripts, 859 were increased in expression, and 827 were decreased in expression at least 2-fold across differentiation. To focus in on genes that were more specific to differentiation, the same analysis was performed on IDX plus TsA-treated non-differentiating cells and all probe sets from the IDX-only group that exhibited similar expression profiles in the non-differentiating TsA-treated group were excluded leaving a total of 1016 transcripts that were regulated only under differentiating conditions. Six hundred and thirty-six of these transcripts were elevated at least 2-fold and 380 exhibited a decrease in expression relative to time 0 preadipocytes. This group of genes was further analyzed using hierarchical clustering and self-organizing maps and resulted in the identification of numerous genes not previously known to be regulated during adipocyte differentiation. Many of these genes may well represent novel adipogenic mediators and markers of adipogenesis.					1649	94104	10159	214	3659	1009	55629	394	3799	55704	5921	23557	5937	196	84146	9367	4008	1386	7741	6474	1902	22848	4969	56995	5311	5074	55186	55614	154796	7155	64400	6611	6591	6558	466	23379	2049	2619	1647	23360	92	55193	3987	29110	120534	388646	10565	4784	2908	1281	3422	9204	643836	11342	4082	9584	6595

Murine and human hematopoietic stem cells share a number of expressed gene products, which define key conserved regulatory pathways in this developmental system. Moreover, in the mouse, a portion of the genetic program of hematopoietic stem cells is shared with embryonic and neural stem cells.

The insulin/IGF-1 (insulin-like growth factor 1) signalling pathway promotes adipocyte differentiation via complex signalling networks. Here, using microarray analysis of brown preadipocytes that are derived from wild-type and insulin receptor substrate (Irs) knockout animals that exhibit progressively impaired differentiation, we define 374 genes/expressed-sequence tags whose expression in preadipocytes correlates with the ultimate ability of the cells to differentiate. Many of these genes, including preadipocyte factor-1 (Pref-1) and multiple members of the Wnt signalling pathway, are related to early adipogenic events.

We have employed microarray technology using RNA from normal 3T3-L1 adipocytes and from 3T3-L1 adipocytes made insulin-resistant by treatment with tumor necrosis factor-alpha to identify a new class of insulin-responsive genes. These genes continued to respond normally to insulin even though the adipocytes themselves were metabolically insulin-resistant, i.e. they displayed a significantly decreased rate of insulin-stimulated glucose uptake. Approximately 12,000 genes/expressed sequence tags (ESTs) were screened. Of these, 40 genes/ESTs were identified that became insulin-resistant as expected (e.g. Socs-3, junB, and matrix metalloproteinase-11). However, 61 genes/ESTs continued to respond normally to insulin. Although some of these genes were previously shown to be regulated by insulin (e.g. Glut-1 and beta3-adrenergic receptor), other novel insulin-sensitive genes were also identified (e.g. Egr-1, epiregulin, Fra-1, and ABCA1). Real-time reverse transcription-PCR analysis confirmed the expression patterns of several of the differentially expressed genes. One gene that remained insulin-sensitive in the insulin-resistant adipocytes is the transcription factor Egr-1. Using an antisense strategy, we show that tissue factor and macrophage colony-stimulating factor, two cardiovascular risk factors, are downstream EGR-1 target genes in the adipocyte. Taken together, these data support the hypothesis that some signaling pathways remain insulin-sensitive in metabolically insulin-resistant adipocytes. These pathways may promote abnormal gene expression in hyperinsulinemic states like obesity and type II diabetes and thus may contribute to pathologies associated with these conditions.					64781	122786	9021	5054	4502	6645	205	23082	6498	4783	4665	3726	91543	9208	79080	116143	5311	23179	2919

NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase (CPR) is an essential component for the function of many enzymes, including microsomal cytochrome P450 (P450) monooxygenases and heme oxygenases. In liver-Cpr-null (with liver-specific Cpr deletion) and Cpr-low (with reduced CPR expression in all organs examined) mouse models, a reduced serum cholesterol level and an induction of hepatic P450s were observed, whereas hepatomegaly and fatty liver were only observed in the liver-Cpr-null model. Our goal was to identify hepatic gene expression changes related to these phenotypes. Cpr-lox mice (with a floxed Cpr gene and normal CPR expression) were used as the control. Through microarray analysis, we identified many genes that were differentially expressed among the three groups of mice. We also recognized the 12 gene ontology terms that contained the most significantly changed gene expression in at least one of the two mouse models. We further uncovered potential mechanisms, such as an increased activation of constitutive androstane receptor and a decreased activation of peroxisomal proliferator-activated receptor-alpha by precursors of cholesterol biosynthesis, that underlie common changes (e.g. induction of multiple P450s and suppression of genes for fatty acid metabolism) in response to CPR loss in the two mouse models. Additionally, we observed model-specific gene expression changes, such as the induction of a fatty-acid translocase (Cd36 antigen) and the suppression of carnitine O-palmitoyltransferase 1 (Cpt1a) and acyl-CoA synthetase long chain family member 1 (Acsl1), that are potentially responsible for the severe hepatic lipidosis and an altered fatty acid profile observed in liver-Cpr-null mice.					2947	1548	308	71	54884	10965	118429	957	1555	8876	2939	4616	2946	440	3956	1581	3162	6579	29094	1562	2267

Zmpste24 (also called FACE-1) is a metalloproteinase involved in the maturation of lamin A (Lmna), an essential component of the nuclear envelope. Both Zmpste24- and Lmna-deficient mice exhibit profound nuclear architecture abnormalities and multiple histopathological defects that phenocopy an accelerated ageing process. Similarly, diverse human progeroid syndromes are caused by mutations in ZMPSTE24 or LMNA genes. To elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying these devastating diseases, we have analysed the transcriptional alterations occurring in tissues from Zmpste24-deficient mice. We demonstrate that Zmpste24 deficiency elicits a stress signalling pathway that is evidenced by a marked upregulation of p53 target genes, and accompanied by a senescence phenotype at the cellular level and accelerated ageing at the organismal level. These phenotypes are largely rescued in Zmpste24-/-Lmna+/- mice and partially reversed in Zmpste24-/-p53-/- mice. These findings provide evidence for the existence of a checkpoint response activated by the nuclear abnormalities caused by prelamin A accumulation, and support the concept that hyperactivation of the tumour suppressor p53 may cause accelerated ageing.					54541	4609	1153	1592	1453	2872	3953	9572	2077	51274	23154	7133	9261	9766	10628	641638	468	7704	27244	55361	415116	678	27297	929	4616	261726	92014	10912	104	6574	1026	23316	1647	598	10458	6004	467	56905	3006	7832

The insulin/IGF-1 (insulin-like growth factor 1) signalling pathway promotes adipocyte differentiation via complex signalling networks. Here, using microarray analysis of brown preadipocytes that are derived from wild-type and insulin receptor substrate (Irs) knockout animals that exhibit progressively impaired differentiation, we define 374 genes/expressed-sequence tags whose expression in preadipocytes correlates with the ultimate ability of the cells to differentiate. Many of these genes, including preadipocyte factor-1 (Pref-1) and multiple members of the Wnt signalling pathway, are related to early adipogenic events. Necdin is also markedly increased in Irs knockout cells that cannot differentiate, and knockdown of necdin restores brown adipogenesis with downregulation of Pref-1 and Wnt10a expression. Insulin receptor substrate proteins regulate a necdin-E2F4 interaction that represses peroxisome-proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) transcription via a cyclic AMP response element binding protein (CREB)-dependent pathway.

Nitric oxide (NO) can modulate numerous genes directly; however, some genes may be modulated only in the presence of the inflammatory stimuli that increase the expression of the inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). One method by which to examine changes in NO-mediated gene expression is to carry out a gene array analysis on NO-nai;ve cells. Herein, we report a gene array analysis on mRNA from iNOS-null (iNOS(-/-)) mouse hepatocytes harvested from mice exposed to NO by infection with an adenovirus expressing human iNOS (Ad-iNOS). Of the 6500 genes on this array, only approximately 200 were modulated either up or down by the increased iNOS activity according to our criteria for significance. Several clearly defined families of genes were modulated, including genes coding for proinflammatory transcription factors, cytokines, cytokine receptors, proteins associated with cell proliferation and cellular energetics, as well as proteins involved in apoptosis. Our results suggest that iNOS has a generally anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic role in hepatocytes but also acts to suppress proliferation and protein synthesis. The expression of iNOS results in increased expression of stress-related proteins, including heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1). We used HO-1 to confirm that a significant change identified by an analysis could be demonstrated as significant in cells and tissues. The elevation of HO-1 was confirmed at the protein level in hepatocytes in vitro. Furthermore, iNOS(-/-) mice experienced greatly increased liver injury subsequent to intestinal ischemia/reperfusion injury, associated with an inability to upregulate HO-1. This is the first study to address the global gene changes induced by iNOS in any cell type, and the findings presented herein may have clinical relevance for conditions such as septic or hemorrhagic shock in which hepatocytes, NO, and HO-1 play a crucial role.					513	2923	10971	9535	4508	10567	836	826	2767	1984	1581	948	6540	5130	26353	5315	6774	1645	4245	10278	60	8737	4627	7416	3460	6237	4633	9512	2161	2287	6659	2230	8672	3315	10809	9908	4124	5499	975	3075	8322	3728	1356	2730	7106	8512	5605	7316	710	2783	1915	527	81	1778	64321	162	677	8662	1937	1522	5635	2512	977	1938	6652	4774	351	5518	4150	338	784	7450	1656	9601	462	6301	2584	3455	10581	8682	1642	3249	476	160	10247	3240	563	6324	8894	6535	2168	9361	7137	241	5917	136853

The molecular mechanisms that regulate cellular differentiation during development and throughout life are complex. It is now recognized that precise patterns of differentially expressed genes ultimately direct a particular cell toward a given lineage and many of these are regulated during the earliest stages of differentiation. Using a microarray-based expression analysis, we have examined gene expression profiles during the first 24 h of 3T3-L1 adipocyte differentiation. RNA was isolated at times 0, 2, 8, 16, and 24 h following stimulation of differentiation and hybridized in duplicate to high density Affymetrix microarray gene chips containing a series of 13,179 cDNA/expressed sequence tag (EST) probe sets. Two hundred and eighty-five cDNA/ESTs were shown to have at least a fivefold change in expression levels during this time course and both hierarchical and self-organizing map clustering analysis was performed to categorize them by expression profiles. Several genes known to be regulated during this time period were confirmed and Western blot analysis of the proteins encoded by some of the identified genes revealed expression profiles similar to their mRNA counterparts. As expected, many of the genes identified have not been examined in such a critical time period during adipogenesis and may well represent novel adipogenic mediators.					9962	379	140809	51316	5464	688	116143	9446	9689	5447	7514	6566	22800	10528	9588	8061	9057	25939	7351	7280	2069	10171	7074	5504	7150	960	3678	55615	10383	9173	602	1831	3428	1051	10875	8091	7421	7004	10808

Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) is implicated in the maintenance of genomic integrity, given that inhibition or depletion of this enzyme increases genomic instability in cells exposed to genotoxic agents. We previously showed that immortalized fibroblasts derived from PARP(-/-) mice exhibit an unstable tetraploid population, and partial chromosomal gains and losses in PARP(-/-) mice and immortalized fibroblasts are accompanied by changes in the expression of p53, Rb, and c-Jun, as well as other proteins. A tetraploid population has also now been detected in primary fibroblasts derived from PARP(-/-) mice. Oligonucleotide microarray analysis was applied to characterize more comprehensively the differences in gene expression between asynchronously dividing primary fibroblasts derived from PARP(-/-) mice and their wild-type littermates. Of the 11,000 genes monitored, 91 differentially expressed genes were identified. The loss of PARP results in down-regulation of the expression of several genes involved in regulation of cell cycle progression or mitosis, DNA replication, or chromosomal processing or assembly. PARP deficiency also up-regulates genes that encode extracellular matrix or cytoskeletal proteins that are implicated in cancer initiation or progression or in normal or premature aging. These results provide insight into the mechanism by which PARP deficiency impairs mitotic function, thereby resulting in the genomic alterations and chromosomal abnormalities as well as in altered expression of genes that may contribute to genomic instability, cancer, and aging.					871	9133	3925	5557	5111	4684	6418	891	991	1786	8407	6696	890	3148	5905	27338	3861

E3 ligases are involved in maintaining the anergic state. However, the specific molecules responsible for the induction of anergy have yet to be elucidated. Using microarray analysis we have identified here early growth response gene 2 (Egr-2) and Egr-3 as key negative regulators of T cell activation. Overexpression of Egr2 and Egr3 was associated with an increase in the E3 ubiquitin ligase Cbl-b and inhibition of T cell activation. Conversely, T cells from Egr3(-/-) mice had lower expression of Cbl-b and were resistant to in vivo peptide-induced tolerance. These data support the idea that Egr-2 and Egr-3 are involved in promoting a T cell receptor-induced negative regulatory genetic program.					3662	976	3945	8556	27283	2846	23452	1510	2557	55030	183	4643	2120	3131	23243	55504	55213	8744	4929	677	8013	6348	2534	26253	25897	8645	1959	8630	23531	959	23062	1848	4641	1740	27086	3718	5552	3728	135	112858	6346	3767	136	55315	56479	25819	51257	23593	5045	27285	780	8870	1435	81543	27236	51477	2643	6276	56992	51686	1837	4616	122809	58498	51147	837	8676	8399	81	22824	79784	4772	8600	10397	3902	6424	2149	3801	3720	55662	664	23361	7293	10205	8125	4851	5214

The PPARgamma is a key adipogenic determination factor. Ligands for PPARgamma such as antidiabetic thiazolidinedione (TZD) compounds are adipogenic, and many adipocyte genes that are activated by TZDs contain binding sites for PPARgamma. Like ligands for other nuclear receptors, TZDs can regulate genes positively or negatively. Here, we sought to understand the importance of positive regulation of gene expression by PPARgamma in adipogenesis. Fusion of the potent viral transcriptional activator VP16 to PPARgamma2 (VP16-PPARgamma) created a transcription factor that constitutively and dramatically activated transcription of PPARgamma-responsive genes in the absence of ligand. Forced expression of VP16-PPARgamma in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes using retroviral vectors led to adipogenesis in the absence of standard differentiating medium or any exogenous PPARgamma ligand. Gene microarray analysis revealed that VP16-PPARgamma induced many of the genes associated with adipogenesis and adipocyte function. Thus, direct up-regulation of gene expression by PPARgamma is sufficient for adipogenesis. TZD-induced adipogenesis up-regulated many of the same genes, although some were divergently regulated, including resistin, whose gene expression was reduced inVP16-PPARgamma adipocytes treated with TZDs. These results show that, although activation of PPARgamma by a heterologous activation domain is sufficient for adipogenesis, it is not equivalent to TZD treatment. This conclusion has important implications for understanding biological effects of the TZDs on adipogenesis and insulin sensitization.					155	2180	10062	2167	5468	7376	5091	1050	8639	183	8694	9370	3991	56729	2820	2194	1675

During the safety evaluation process of new drugs and chemicals, a battery of genotoxicity tests is conducted starting with in vitro genotoxicity assays. Obtaining positive results in in vitro genotoxicity tests is not uncommon. Follow-up studies to determine the biological relevance of positive genotoxicity results are costly, time consuming, and utilize animals. More efficient methods, especially for identifying a putative mode of action like an indirect mechanism of genotoxicity (where DNA molecules are not the initial primary targets), would greatly improve the risk assessment for genotoxins. To this end, we are participating in an International Life Sciences Institute (ILSI) project involving studies of gene expression changes caused by model genotoxins. The purpose of the work is to evaluate gene expression tools in general, and specifically for discriminating genotoxins that are direct-acting from indirect-acting. Our lab has evaluated gene expression changes as well as micronuclei (MN) in L5178Y TK(+/-) mouse lymphoma cells treated with six compounds. Direct-acting genotoxins (where DNA is the initial primary target) that were evaluated included the DNA crosslinking agents, mitomycin C (MMC) and cisplatin (CIS), and an alkylating agent, methyl methanesulfonate (MMS). Indirect-acting genotoxins included hydroxyurea (HU), a ribonucleotide reductase inhibitor, taxol (TXL), a microtubule inhibitor, and etoposide (ETOP), a DNA topoisomerase II inhibitor. Microarray gene expression analysis was conducted using Affymetrix mouse oligonucleotide arrays on RNA samples derived from cells which were harvested immediately after the 4 h chemical treatment, and 20 h after the 4 h chemical treatment. The evaluation of these experimental results yields evidence of differentially regulated genes at both 4 and 24 h time points that appear to have discriminating power for direct versus indirect genotoxins, and therefore may serve as a fingerprint for classifying chemicals when their mechanism of action is unknown.					23154	22919	3695	81620	3150	1164	9055	7077	23381	5001	3835	991	10797	143684	3455	6790	4751	83549	3838	995	3727	1894	8335	54443	8454	7589	10906	7134	211	9232	10492	149951	6941	699	3014

To examine the latter, nickel-exposed mice were treated with saline or NOS inhibitor, N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME). Initial microarray analysis of nickel-induced gene expression of saline-treated mice revealed increased inflammatory mediator, matrix injury-repair, and hypoxia-induced factor-mediated sequences and decreased lung-specific (e.g., surfactant-associated protein B and C) sequences. Compared with saline control, L-NAME-treated mice had enhanced survival with attenuated serum nitrate/nitrite, endothelial NOS activity, and lavage neutrophils and protein. Although initial cytokine (i.e., interferon-gamma, interleukins-1beta and -6, macrophage inflammatory protein-2, monocyte chemotactic protein-1, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha) gene expression was similar between groups, subsequent larger cytokine increases only occurred in saline-treated mice. Similarly, surfactant protein gene expression decreased initially in both groups yet was restored subsequently with L-NAME treatment. Interestingly, the role of inducible NOS (iNOS) in these responses seems minimal. iNOS gene expression was unaltered, iNOS activity and nitrotyrosine residues were undetectable, and an iNOS antagonist, aminoguanidine, failed to increase survival. Rather, systemic L-NAME treatment appears to attenuate pulmonary endothelial NOS activity, subsequent cytokine expression, inflammation, and protein permeability, and thereby restores surfactant gene expression and increases survival.					84168	2194	6251	5947	117156	8999	727	976	23462	1572	857	55589	9351	8829	3123	7059	8862	5444	2246	1803	81030	4223	3117	1012	7159	2273	10440	3993	23136	4137	28973	8425	94	9659	9435	126	6440	4784	6387	3039	9619	211	8473	55504	9409	3384	1555	187

An enriched environment is known to promote structural changes in the brain and to enhance learning and memory performance in rodents [Hebb, D. O. (1947) Am. Psychol. 2, 306-307]. To better understand the molecular mechanisms underlying these experience-dependent cognitive changes, we have used high-density oligonucleotide microarrays to analyze gene expression in the brain. Expression of a large number of genes changes in response to enrichment training, many of which can be linked to neuronal structure, synaptic plasticity, and transmission. A number of these genes may play important roles in modulating learning and memory capacity.					1742	84516	808	4134	6902	124925	5691	27005	55760	7436	5432	8192	23549	2017	7511	1000	11151	7545	1603	689	7494	794

We have employed microarray technology using RNA from normal 3T3-L1 adipocytes and from 3T3-L1 adipocytes made insulin-resistant by treatment with tumor necrosis factor-alpha to identify a new class of insulin-responsive genes. These genes continued to respond normally to insulin even though the adipocytes themselves were metabolically insulin-resistant, i.e. they displayed a significantly decreased rate of insulin-stimulated glucose uptake. Approximately 12,000 genes/expressed sequence tags (ESTs) were screened. Of these, 40 genes/ESTs were identified that became insulin-resistant as expected (e.g. Socs-3, junB, and matrix metalloproteinase-11). However, 61 genes/ESTs continued to respond normally to insulin. Although some of these genes were previously shown to be regulated by insulin (e.g. Glut-1 and beta3-adrenergic receptor), other novel insulin-sensitive genes were also identified (e.g. Egr-1, epiregulin, Fra-1, and ABCA1). Real-time reverse transcription-PCR analysis confirmed the expression patterns of several of the differentially expressed genes. One gene that remained insulin-sensitive in the insulin-resistant adipocytes is the transcription factor Egr-1. Using an antisense strategy, we show that tissue factor and macrophage colony-stimulating factor, two cardiovascular risk factors, are downstream EGR-1 target genes in the adipocyte. Taken together, these data support the hypothesis that some signaling pathways remain insulin-sensitive in metabolically insulin-resistant adipocytes. These pathways may promote abnormal gene expression in hyperinsulinemic states like obesity and type II diabetes and thus may contribute to pathologies associated with these conditions.					404550	57035	257397	2549	10628	155	5289	254013	147912	901	5737	200933	54800	9975	23608	19	7704	8707	6988	3148	153222

The c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs) are encoded by three genes that yield 10 isoforms through alternative mRNA splicing. The roles of each JNK isoform in the many putative biological responses where the JNK pathway is activated are still unclear. To examine the cellular responses mediated by different JNK isoforms, gain-of-function JNK1 polypeptides were generated by fusing the upstream mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase, MKK7, with p46JNK1alpha or p46JNK1beta. The MKK7-JNK fusion proteins, which exhibited constitutive activity in 293T cells, were stably expressed in Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts using retrovirus-mediated gene transfer. Swiss 3T3 cells expressing either of the MKK7-JNK polypeptides were equally sensitized to induction of cell death following serum withdrawal. To search for other cellular responses that may be selectively regulated by the JNK1 isoforms, the gene expression profiles of Swiss 3T3 cells expressing MKK7-JNK1alpha or MKK7-JNK1beta were compared with empty vector-transfected control cells. Affymetrix Genechips identified 46 genes for which expression was increased in MKK7-JNK-expressing cells relative to vector control cells. Twenty genes including those for c-Jun, MKP-7, interluekin-1 receptor family member ST2L/ST2, and c-Jun-binding protein were induced similarly by MKK7-JNK1alpha and MKK7-JNK1beta proteins, whereas 13 genes were selectively increased by MKK7-JNK1alpha and 13 genes were selectively increased by MKK7-JNK1beta. The set of genes selectively induced by MKK7-JNK1beta included a number of known interferon-stimulated genes (ISG12, ISG15, IGTP, and GTPI). Consistent with these gene expression changes, Swiss 3T3 cells expressing MKK7-JNK1beta exhibited increased resistance to vesicular stomatitis virus-induced cell death. These findings reveal evidence for JNK isoform-selective gene regulation and support a role for distinct JNK isoforms in specific cellular responses.					345274	3934	6649	7475	6689	929	10512	196	2030	5997	3929	1356	928	718	19	5947	1572	355	9021	4969	972	79101	30001	8519	8491	3487	1291	2662	3290	5074	3977	51477	2690	5360	3037	5168	133418	244	1292

A31 cells in exponential growth were pre-treated with 3AB 4mM 1h before gamma-irradiation (4Gy), remaining in culture during 6h until harvesting time. A31 cells treated with 3AB alone presented a down-regulation in genes involved in protein processing and cell cycle control, while an up-regulation of genes involved in apoptosis and related to DNA/RNA synthesis and repair was verified. A31 cells irradiated with 4Gy displayed 41 genes differentially expressed, being detected a down-regulation of genes involved in protein processing and apoptosis, and genes controlling the cell cycle. Concomitantly, another set of genes for protein processing and related to DNA/RNA synthesis and repair were found to be up-regulated. A positive or negative interaction effect between 3AB and radiation was verified for 29 known genes. While the combined treatment induced a synergistic effect on the expression of LCK proto-oncogene and several genes related to protein synthesis/processing, a negative interaction effect was found for the expression of genes related to cytoskeleton and extracellular matrix assembly (SATB1 and Anexin III), cell cycle control (tyrosine kinase), and genes participating in DNA/RNA synthesis and repair (RNA helicase, FLAP endonuclease-1, DNA-3 glycosylase methyladenine, splicing factor SC35 and Soh1). The present data open the possibility to investigate the direct participation of specific genes, or gene products acting in concert in the mechanism underlying the cell response to radiation-induced DNA damage under the influence of PARP inhibitor.					8292	1452	51380	55667	6304	9556	10189	663	122830	306	1798	2237	8653	11344	51003	55114	4350	2953

Insulin and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) act through highly homologous receptors that engage similar intracellular signaling pathways, yet these hormones serve largely distinct physiological roles in the control of metabolism and growth, respectively. In an attempt to uncover the molecular mechanisms underlying their divergent functions, we compared insulin receptor (IR) and IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R) regulation of gene expression by microarray analysis, using 3T3-L1 cells expressing either TrkC/IR or TrkC/IGF-1R chimeric receptors to ensure the highly selective activation of each receptor tyrosine kinase. Following stimulation of the chimeric receptors for 4 h, we detected 11 genes to be differentially regulated, of which 10 were up-regulated to a greater extent by the IGF-1R. These included genes involved in adhesion, transcription, transport, and proliferation. The expression of mRNA encoding heparin-binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor (HB-EGF), a potent mitogen, was markedly increased by IGF-1R but not IR activation. This effect was dependent on MAPK, but not phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and did not require an autocrine loop through the epidermal growth factor receptor. HB-EGF mitogenic activity was detectable in the medium of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes expressing activated IGF-1R but not IR, indicating that the transcriptional response is accompanied by a parallel increase in mature HB-EGF protein. The differential abilities of the IR and IGF-1R tyrosine kinases to stimulate the synthesis and release of a growth factor may provide, at least in part, an explanation for the greater role of the IGF-1R in the control of cellular proliferation.					114915	9467	51170	11152	5166	7357	5074	3005	8738	8850	5727	29969	9367

Division of spermatogonial stem cells produces daughter cells that either maintain their stem cell identity or undergo differentiation to form mature sperm. The Sertoli cell, the only somatic cell within seminiferous tubules, provides the stem cell niche through physical support and expression of surface proteins and soluble factors. Here we show that the Ets related molecule (ERM) is expressed exclusively within Sertoli cells in the testis and is required for spermatogonial stem cell self-renewal. Mice with targeted disruption of ERM have a loss of maintenance of spermatogonial stem cell self-renewal without a block in normal spermatogenic differentiation and thus have progressive germ-cell depletion and a Sertoli-cell-only syndrome. Microarray analysis of primary Sertoli cells from ERM-deficient mice showed alterations in secreted factors known to regulate the haematopoietic stem cell niche. These results identify a new function for the Ets family transcription factors in spermatogenesis and provide an example of transcriptional control of a vertebrate stem cell niche.					83879	1618	3070	346673	4288	5940	1662	1381	54801	57820	5933	5888	1633	6658	11144	1017	9134	8277	7046	4171	284023	4801	4085

During cellular differentiation and development, it is recognized that many complex molecular mechanisms as well as precise patterns of differentially expressed genes occur in directing precursor cells toward a given lineage. Using microarray-based technology, we examined gene expression across the course of 3T3-L1 adipocyte differentiation. Total cellular RNA was isolated at times 0, 2, 8, 16, 24, 48, and 96 h following treatment with either standard hormonal inducers of differentiation; insulin, dexamethasone, isobutylmethylxanthine (IDX), or IDX plus trichostatin A (TsA), a histone deacetylase inhibitor and potent adipogenic inhibitor. cRNA was synthesized from cellular RNA and hybridized to high density Affymetrix MG_U74Av2 microarray gene chips containing 12,488 cDNA/Expressed Sequence Tags (ESTs) probe sets. From the IDX-only treated cells, all probe sets that were either unchanged or differentially expressed less than 2-fold throughout differentiation with respect to time 0 preadipocytes were excluded from further analyses. This selection resulted in a net of 1686 transcripts, 859 were increased in expression, and 827 were decreased in expression at least 2-fold across differentiation. To focus in on genes that were more specific to differentiation, the same analysis was performed on IDX plus TsA-treated non-differentiating cells and all probe sets from the IDX-only group that exhibited similar expression profiles in the non-differentiating TsA-treated group were excluded leaving a total of 1016 transcripts that were regulated only under differentiating conditions. Six hundred and thirty-six of these transcripts were elevated at least 2-fold and 380 exhibited a decrease in expression relative to time 0 preadipocytes. This group of genes was further analyzed using hierarchical clustering and self-organizing maps and resulted in the identification of numerous genes not previously known to be regulated during adipocyte differentiation. Many of these genes may well represent novel adipogenic mediators and markers of adipogenesis.					3398	3965	1465	54985	5743	50807	29952	301	22822	83593	6347	3491	1958	3728	1796	9475	60412	9823	5580	6387	65009	2669	4128	10437	57544	9265	9314	1435	9564	50865	9590	7164	1266	2585	2535	2896	58533	2919	11342	1030	23270	7168	2152	6423	1052	92	5321	2052	146556	8434	3992	10156	10916	84333	22920	2149	6354	80739	7057	1500	3399	112770	2944	1019	6696	2353	5327	6546	1029	4833	7412	26524	10370	10769	1265	2239	1759	10979	163590	6814	23564	311	51421	2952	23111	64747	2681	8935	2620	7058	4739	22933

The insulin/IGF-1 (insulin-like growth factor 1) signalling pathway promotes adipocyte differentiation via complex signalling networks. Here, using microarray analysis of brown preadipocytes that are derived from wild-type and insulin receptor substrate (Irs) knockout animals that exhibit progressively impaired differentiation, we define 374 genes/expressed-sequence tags whose expression in preadipocytes correlates with the ultimate ability of the cells to differentiate. Many of these genes, including preadipocyte factor-1 (Pref-1) and multiple members of the Wnt signalling pathway, are related to early adipogenic events. Necdin is also markedly increased in Irs knockout cells that cannot differentiate, and knockdown of necdin restores brown adipogenesis with downregulation of Pref-1 and Wnt10a expression. Insulin receptor substrate proteins regulate a necdin-E2F4 interaction that represses peroxisome-proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) transcription via a cyclic AMP response element binding protein (CREB)-dependent pathway. Together these define a key signalling network that is involved in brown preadipocyte determination.					6932	57761	58480	100133941	1382	8840	2743	669	1030	6300	8788	1294	28988	7371	5792	654	51202	4826	11098	9023	833	80326	136	1948	4256	10797	4692	2273	284023	2707

The expression of 579 genes was significantly up- or down-regulated by more than 1.5-fold during differentiation and/or by treatment with TZD, and these genes were organized into 32 clusters that demonstrated concerted changes in expression of genes controlling cell growth or lipid metabolism. Quantitative PCR was employed to further characterize gene expression and led to the identification of beta-catenin as a new PPAR gamma target gene. Both mRNA and protein levels for beta-catenin were down-regulated in 3T3-L1 adipocytes compared with fibroblasts and were further decreased by treatment of adipocytes with PPAR gamma agonists. Treatment of db/db mice with a PPAR gamma agonist also resulted in reduction of beta-catenin mRNA levels in adipose tissue. These results suggest that beta-catenin plays an important role in the regulation of adipogenesis. Thus, the transcriptional patterns revealed in this study further the understanding of adipogenesis process and the function of PPAR gamma activation.					6774	6319	348	5376	2879	155	9370	37	3679	35	217	6776	3939	4170	6342	1376	123	8878	2167	3991	5468	5464	1675	1384	64682	2171	593	2194	3945	2690	7436	1647	1051	5091	2180	183	3479	1351	63924	6772	948	1649	57678	5160	4335	7422	2730	8404	7423

NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase (CPR) is an essential component for the function of many enzymes, including microsomal cytochrome P450 (P450) monooxygenases and heme oxygenases. In liver-Cpr-null (with liver-specific Cpr deletion) and Cpr-low (with reduced CPR expression in all organs examined) mouse models, a reduced serum cholesterol level and an induction of hepatic P450s were observed, whereas hepatomegaly and fatty liver were only observed in the liver-Cpr-null model. Our goal was to identify hepatic gene expression changes related to these phenotypes. Cpr-lox mice (with a floxed Cpr gene and normal CPR expression) were used as the control. Through microarray analysis, we identified many genes that were differentially expressed among the three groups of mice. We also recognized the 12 gene ontology terms that contained the most significantly changed gene expression in at least one of the two mouse models. We further uncovered potential mechanisms, such as an increased activation of constitutive androstane receptor and a decreased activation of peroxisomal proliferator-activated receptor-alpha by precursors of cholesterol biosynthesis, that underlie common changes (e.g. induction of multiple P450s and suppression of genes for fatty acid metabolism) in response to CPR loss in the two mouse models. Additionally, we observed model-specific gene expression changes, such as the induction of a fatty-acid translocase (Cd36 antigen) and the suppression of carnitine O-palmitoyltransferase 1 (Cpt1a) and acyl-CoA synthetase long chain family member 1 (Acsl1), that are potentially responsible for the severe hepatic lipidosis and an altered fatty acid profile observed in liver-Cpr-null mice.					3479	375775	22809	27314	622	51170	8876	6385	10808	54884	10965	2246	1962	10993	3320	9420	5890	2169	337	25819

During cellular differentiation and development, it is recognized that many complex molecular mechanisms as well as precise patterns of differentially expressed genes occur in directing precursor cells toward a given lineage. Using microarray-based technology, we examined gene expression across the course of 3T3-L1 adipocyte differentiation. Total cellular RNA was isolated at times 0, 2, 8, 16, 24, 48, and 96 h following treatment with either standard hormonal inducers of differentiation; insulin, dexamethasone, isobutylmethylxanthine (IDX), or IDX plus trichostatin A (TsA), a histone deacetylase inhibitor and potent adipogenic inhibitor. cRNA was synthesized from cellular RNA and hybridized to high density Affymetrix MG_U74Av2 microarray gene chips containing 12,488 cDNA/Expressed Sequence Tags (ESTs) probe sets. From the IDX-only treated cells, all probe sets that were either unchanged or differentially expressed less than 2-fold throughout differentiation with respect to time 0 preadipocytes were excluded from further analyses. This selection resulted in a net of 1686 transcripts, 859 were increased in expression, and 827 were decreased in expression at least 2-fold across differentiation. To focus in on genes that were more specific to differentiation, the same analysis was performed on IDX plus TsA-treated non-differentiating cells and all probe sets from the IDX-only group that exhibited similar expression profiles in the non-differentiating TsA-treated group were excluded leaving a total of 1016 transcripts that were regulated only under differentiating conditions. Six hundred and thirty-six of these transcripts were elevated at least 2-fold and 380 exhibited a decrease in expression relative to time 0 preadipocytes. This group of genes was further analyzed using hierarchical clustering and self-organizing maps and resulted in the identification of numerous genes not previously known to be regulated during adipocyte differentiation. Many of these genes may well represent novel adipogenic mediators and markers of adipogenesis.					977	10010	1306	3032	820	8694	5005	1468	4158	6319	949	341	4715	4060	112	2632	11112	50486	9444	1743	23554	3240	513	1666	4711	3033	9370	134147	5664	387893	8802	8850	28996	3934	28976	51571	873	8639	8200	8436	83549	5860	9545	4257	84293	64859	4712	57136	9526	10938	2110	54996	4837	54976	25849	729359	79095	51258	8398	27089	5827	5004	5919	51144	1349	25813	6517	94081	4698	3290	364	761	51015	2395	210	10518	35	25979	10449	11343	7905	664	1528	9448	847	1737	6573	1629	56729	4722	4056	4714	10400	348	29968	6389	7069	2194	5525	388581	3945	2936	1652	56994	225	539	5162	4023	58476	6342	149685	81689	2954	5236	221545	56246	11019	7381	2184	83752	56922	65124	51449	26994	29796	9094	5824	4709	5445	2653	7086	6576	7263	4199	57104	19	6390	80777	98	3295	2819	54927	1675	84274	4162	7284	1329	56894	292	10124	3655	6444	760	11030	63924	10313	92840	6279	4719	6271	33	11333	587	4704	901	211	1431	1031	1738	1717	4717	594	912	4967	29103	203228	10062	1347	6391	25819	57157	257397	7385	128488	54884	4713	26275	7384	3614

The molecular mechanisms that regulate cellular differentiation during development and throughout life are complex. It is now recognized that precise patterns of differentially expressed genes ultimately direct a particular cell toward a given lineage and many of these are regulated during the earliest stages of differentiation. Using a microarray-based expression analysis, we have examined gene expression profiles during the first 24 h of 3T3-L1 adipocyte differentiation. RNA was isolated at times 0, 2, 8, 16, and 24 h following stimulation of differentiation and hybridized in duplicate to high density Affymetrix microarray gene chips containing a series of 13,179 cDNA/expressed sequence tag (EST) probe sets. Two hundred and eighty-five cDNA/ESTs were shown to have at least a fivefold change in expression levels during this time course and both hierarchical and self-organizing map clustering analysis was performed to categorize them by expression profiles. Several genes known to be regulated during this time period were confirmed and Western blot analysis of the proteins encoded by some of the identified genes revealed expression profiles similar to their mRNA counterparts. As expected, many of the genes identified have not been examined in such a critical time period during adipogenesis and may well represent novel adipogenic mediators.					990	8208	23	1786	4173	63901	5631	55723	3428	29074	6241	283871	10592	4176	83879	4534	1893	27131	1462	1854	8520	3070	5424	3159	10061	23649	83743	445	4174	2237	3148	9188	4676	4172	12	2956	4175	133418	7866	5888

Expression and function of the oncogenic transcription factor activator protein (AP-1; mainly composed of Jun and Fos proteins) is required for neoplastic transformation of keratinocytes in vitro and tumor promotion as well as malignant progression in vivo. Here, we describe the identification of 372 differentially expressed genes comparing skin tumor samples of K5-SOS-F transgenic mice (Fos(f/f) SOS(+)) with samples derived from animals with a specific deletion of c-Fos in keratinocytes (Fos(Deltaep) SOS(+)). Fos-dependent transcription of selected genes was confirmed by quantitative real-time PCR analysis using tumor samples and mouse back skin treated with the tumor promoter 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA). One of the most differentially expressed genes encodes the small mucin-like glycoprotein Podoplanin (Pdpn), whose expression correlates with malignant progression in mouse tumor model systems and human cancer. We found Pdpn and Fos expression in chemically induced mouse skin tumors, and detailed analysis of the Pdpn gene promoter revealed impaired activity in Fos-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts, which could be restored by ectopic Fos expression. Direct Fos protein binding to the Pdpn promoter was shown by chromatin immunoprecipitation and a TPA-induced complex at a TPA-responsive element-like motif in the proximal promoter was identified by electrophoretic mobility shift assays. In summary, we could define a Fos-dependent genetic program in a well-established model of skin tumors. Systematic analysis of these novel target genes will guide us in elucidating the molecular mechanisms of AP-1-regulated pathways that are critically implicated in neoplastic transformation and/or malignant progression.					55825	3796	4128	79603	130271	22915	196743	9399	8572	670	4783	10799	3925	4257	760	28971	55505	56963	8784	3849	9232	1152	6274	3960	85236	3028	22911	8345	92196	2620	8689	3283	85414	5983	158833	64102	219854	10557	2134	3018	8644	4502	7869	83401	57152	7468	11051	6565	4054	142940	2987	1877	5805	1307	57463	91687	4190	140885	55229	1628	374291	27293	55603	254228	126	26353	5745	3488	51027	55301	440021	55289	27106	51188	150379	390213	10536	38	79071	3008	1586	51236	79020	388581	4292	54897	84268	5579

Among these proteins, CXCL1 has been reported to promote NSCLC development, whereas interleukin-18 (IL-18) has an undefined role. Genetic and pharmacologic strategies to inhibit CXCL1 and IL-18 revealed that stromal cell migration, LKR-13 cell proliferation, and LKR-13 cell tumorigenicity required one or both of these proteins. We conclude that stromal cells enhanced LKR-13 cell tumorigenicity partly through their effects on the secretome of LKR-13 cells. Strategies to inhibit tumor/stromal cell interactions may be useful as therapeutic approaches in NSCLC patients.					10232	5691	5689	319101	1277	7533	1893	3251	7178	1191	10971	5694	65979	5686	10036	4736	4478	5034	3959	22883	7167	2517	2739	5224	1471	6678	2805	79036	59	5682	9588	87	1522	4507	4869	3326	7311	822	10447	4000	6418	7184	5768	7415	7534	629	7412	4860	3612	64129	351	4199	6385	1504	10577	1508	396	5037	1938	2821	6142	226	5693	375790	231	10159	7148	154881	3146	1509	999	9446	5692	9748	10399	2936	11315	4191	4924	51056	9595	60	5901	6696	5685	5052	5688	1356	197	462	5684	633	7531	3083	350	7414	2944	5168	1917	23549	5644	124583	2027	3939	5480	2941	3960	2335	811	56925	9948	7018	7077	7529	307	2023	6376	81	717	928	1015	5269	10512	5230	51031	387	5315	80781	975	3698	2950	5690

Invasion of lymphatic vessels is a key step in the metastasis of primary tumors to draining lymph nodes. Although the process is enhanced by tumor lymphangiogenesis, it is unclear whether this is a consequence of increased lymphatic vessel number, altered lymphatic vessel properties, or both. Here we have addressed the question by comparing the RNA profiles of primary lymphatic endothelial cells (LEC) isolated from the vasculature of normal tissue and from highly metastatic T-241/vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-C fibrosarcomas implanted in C57BL/6 mice. Our findings reveal significant differences in expression of some 792 genes (i.e., >or=2-fold up- or down-regulated, P <or= 0.05) that code for a variety of proteins including components of endothelial junctions, subendothelial matrix, and vessel growth/patterning. The tumor LEC profile, validated by immunohistochemical staining, is distinct from that of normal, inflammatory cytokine, or mitogen-activated LEC, characterized by elevated expression of such functionally significant molecules as the tight junction regulatory protein endothelial specific adhesion molecule (ESAM), the transforming growth factor-beta coreceptor Endoglin (CD105), the angiogenesis-associated leptin receptor, and the immunoinhibitory receptor CD200, and reduced expression of subendothelial matrix proteins including collagens, fibrillin, and biglycan. Moreover, we show similar induction of ESAM, Endoglin, and leptin receptor within tumor lymphatics in a series of human head and neck and colorectal carcinomas, and uncover a dramatic correlation between ESAM expression and nodal metastasis that identifies this marker as a possible prognostic indicator. These findings reveal a remarkable degree of phenotypic plasticity in cancer lymphatics and provide new insight into the processes of lymphatic invasion and lymph node metastasis.					5155	5819	3953	3371	285	7043	7042	1906	133	1525	4345	50848	10252	7057	3215	90952	219699	2022	5292	84962

To dissect the complex interaction between Muc2 and Apc in intestinal tumorigenesis and to elucidate the mechanisms of tumor formation in Muc2(-/-) mice, we crossed the Muc2(-/-) mouse with two mouse models, Apc(1638N/+) and Apc(Min/+), each of which carries an inactivated Apc allele. The introduction of mutant Muc2 into Apc(1638N/+) and Apc(Min/+) mice greatly increased transformation induced by the Apc mutation and significantly shifted tumor development toward the colon as a function of Muc2 gene dosage. Furthermore, we showed that in compound double mutant mice, deregulation of Wnt signaling was the dominant mechanism of tumor formation. The increased tumor burden in the distal colon of Muc2/Apc double mutant mice was similar to the phenotype observed in Apc(Min/+) mice that are challenged to mount an inflammatory response, and consistent with this, gene expression profiles of epithelial cells from flat mucosa of Muc2-deficient mice suggested that Muc2 deficiency was associated with low levels of subclinical chronic inflammation.

Radiotherapy is widely used to treat human cancer. Patients locally recurring after radiotherapy, however, have increased risk of metastatic progression and poor prognosis. The clinical management of postradiation recurrences remains an unresolved issue. Tumors growing in preirradiated tissues have an increased fraction of hypoxic cells and are more metastatic, a condition known as tumor bed effect. The transcription factor hypoxia inducible factor (HIF)-1 promotes invasion and metastasis of hypoxic tumors, but its role in the tumor bed effect has not been reported. Here, we show that tumor cells derived from SCCVII and HCT116 tumors growing in a preirradiated bed, or selected in vitro through repeated cycles of severe hypoxia, retain invasive and metastatic capacities when returned to normoxia. HIF activity, although facilitating metastatic spreading of tumors growing in a preirradiated bed, is not essential. Through gene expression profiling and gain- and loss-of-function experiments, we identified the matricellular protein CYR61 and alphaVbeta5 integrin as proteins cooperating to mediate these effects. The anti-alphaV integrin monoclonal antibody 17E6 and the small molecular alphaVbeta3/alphaVbeta5 integrin inhibitor EMD121974 suppressed invasion and metastasis induced by CYR61 and attenuated metastasis of tumors growing within a preirradiated field. These results represent a conceptual advance to the understanding of the tumor bed effect and identify CYR61 and alphaVbeta5 integrin as proteins that cooperate to mediate metastasis. They also identify alphaV integrin inhibition as a potential therapeutic approach for preventing metastasis in patients at risk for postradiation recurrences.					8848	9117	65082	7186	1981	1462	6612	7037	8106	9618	220064	9128	23413	2648	79039	9353	9487	56957	4313	10868	5887	2069	117178	651746	23531	9647	113419	80742	3304	10869	387893	55074	55970	9173	23246	5471	80317	58517	56931	9489	9044	23214	84273	23223	79072	51267	150365	6645	9673	4086	445	10514	146923	4097	374354	6597	5577	26585	26015	65108	5606	125488	147741	5781	22823	1611	6558	57551	57491	204851	1654	4953	57381	51094	6415	2230	488	4837	79692	6573	54815	84916	1387	29914	80155	8833	4163	79811	55665	60528	54796	29947	317781	51236	55153	23621	10268	6372	1003	115708	5578	5411	4522	481	80209	25885	10908	147179	118813	8165	84501	25828	3954	2889	9221	6723	116225	84920	6059	6599	10098	203	23171	2036	23378	79613	50854	64782	2729	8662	444	2817	4660	7332	231	10940	151742	201626	6575	55720	6382	284106	55666	51296	84912	57154	9904	3308	85403	904	124245	10528	23034	8273	64397	117246	476	9782	51132	79071	22937	10120	283899	51747	1468	51307	25929	4363	9277	55652	57820	5373	64223	54726	92140	84321	9816	54439	79734	55379	88455	10492	54520	51735	10493	161424	22824	112495	2731	27076	55170	5878	84734	55749	4121	63925	4686	57508	122616	9790	80148	8061	10399	3589	4548	51304	2936	8420	23024	55066	1021	7993	59343	200081	9908	54955	27161	271	25875	1104	9570	27289	4234	9684	2744	10227	140890	5130	157855	23435	8518	311	1394	8314	283131	10269	9057	138065	54934	5226	4651	10322	25836	3837	3190	2113	56987	83743	23381	8846	81554	79711	165	57099	7498	64393	10432	6711	10630	7168	9306	8638	5091	4615	58477	6352	64759	11021	2730	7871	6563	4794	7127	11333	54856	9879	85477	586	644815	6900	124540	23017	6535	9448	55322	55035	25854	81619	54708	1656	51605	5742	8099	10105	4891	817	9791	80018	57222	56919	201965	10984	9129	2539	79183	84251	25800	2107	63027	29760	10413	9700	29088	8829	58487	3375	91442	5295	1058	4052	93624	1432	80150	64960	286205	5547	79892	26168	2120	1783	7296	55075	51107	9761	3983	1024	116535	66036	25940	5396	399665	1979	9147	490	1660	64771	53944	4605	1852	63971	5822	6885	55082	51762	7029	23321	114609	84952	57510	11171	65117	54942	6046	11196	8761	8645	1728	22984	79675	81034	362	9361	6832	113829	1108	10186	5036	55435	26512	57477	28232	9070	2935	55726	2965	9397	25790	5168	26073	26018	22889	55605	79612

They also identify alphaV integrin inhibition as a potential therapeutic approach for preventing metastasis in patients at risk for postradiation recurrences.					1356	64332	5621	54602	1628	51316	11145	1396	3148	246175	2444	158747	3422	3592	55780	4259	10130	29904	57415	79809	84899	220988	56256	94134	55902	203547	3693	140576	55217	4082	57326	3417	664	113246	3491	403	699	84083	66005	7095	80006	79901	140738	4013	6737	5360	8125	90231	389874	51091	220929	1316	80347	706	55739	7319	9965	6772	54751	5167	8575	6498	3516	2842	3669	28966	51805	25897	221491	11284	11167	5480	2535	160518	831	119391	51315	2709	1291	130355	54469	901	1203	9674	54741	2353	55062	3875	51005	717	3725	3005	79575	26061	10553	150274	7259	139886	286	151050	51057	6138	130617	100506742	54629	154796	7494	54206	131076	7360	1192	10437	170622	25839	8625	596	1290	440145	3425	8836	388650	55374	85416	5318	9411	50640	120935	60492	1374	79666	29095	8996	6480	8554	8417	9805	7316	57458	23645	4817	1429	84105	5154	38	7082	80321	1831	29094	56944	79090	25994	2181	5337	847	1337	55603	1122	6990	29926	90488	152185	6892	29058	3074	3656	4709	285753	10411	51501	26262	10110	5933	353322	10406	23549	51274	552889	1519	51115	51079	8909	51374	7052	8558	23077	1666	9367	6655	25915	10761	5211	9080	8553	80198	4092	151648	79573	51651	22832	56929	9886	2651	51201	5292	54558	5147	388	10602	3397	10211	254295	3652	10018	5169	5150	8883	7071	10234	6596	7390	6446	23135	8654	1191	4969	5163	6474	55355	1022	92126	55717	57007	95681	84188	113177	140876	50865	55758	83943	170712	8935	2681	171425	9048	63901	7941	23648	841	283991	1846	6271	84419	6430	84148	2633	2634	388564	10156	23175	163590	51192	1848	9380	390	10106	316	9262	285761	130814	113	9051	26224	307	3198	415116	57146	1293	375287	441478	10499	2037	5532	254263	81622	3202	197370	729967	196294	4047	387263	196074	2896	55722	283897	83463	3135	1958	23514	4017	9975	7114	9217	9601	29089	51422	139322	79036	57620	5611	10912	51668	261729	25864	644	665	8440	55830	9910	10232	10000	6237	84333	1490	116228	374882	112399	10682	100129361	122769	4928	79156	60672	64921	50808	4240	54885	8862	7108	4595	221908	9946	2934	56892	84159	201299	51101	153768	5414	687	26270	27109	144455	64374	26953	123283	220323	2707	51074	54969	7483	64333	134553	3241	8621	55959	29950	84945	57231	65986	154214	58508	9592	80145

The recent identification of cancer stem cells (CSCs) in multiple human cancers provides a new inroad to understanding tumorigenesis at the cellular level. CSCs are defined by their characteristics of self-renewal, multipotentiality, and tumor initiation upon transplantation. By testing for these defining characteristics, we provide evidence for the existence of CSCs in a transgenic mouse model of glioma, S100beta-verbB;Trp53. In this glioma model, CSCs are enriched in the side population (SP) cells. These SP cells have enhanced tumor-initiating capacity, self-renewal, and multipotentiality compared with non-SP cells from the same tumors. Furthermore, gene expression analysis comparing fluorescence-activated cell sorting-sorted cancer SP cells to non-SP cancer cells and normal neural SP cells identified 45 candidate genes that are differentially expressed in glioma stem cells. We validated the expression of two genes from this list (S100a4 and S100a6) in primary mouse gliomas and human glioma samples. Analyses of xenografted human glioblastoma multiforme cell lines and primary human glioma tissues show that S100A4 and S100A6 are expressed in a small subset of cancer cells and that their abundance is positively correlated to tumor grade. In conclusion, this study shows that CSCs exist in a mouse glioma model, suggesting that this model can be used to study the molecular and cellular characteristics of CSCs in vivo and to further test the CSC hypothesis.					1291	55022	133121	3739	316	6447	375567	81621	1292	822	90523	29106	3957	7474	27286	4815	405754	1644	153222	9890	8190	8419	395	633	3171	857	9060	2303	387914	9411	6275	338811	7003	389177	837	54360	6277	2840	4256	55323	4978	2697	254778	9249

Epithelial cells of mucosal surfaces are critical for maintaining immune homeostasis by aiding in the discrimination of pathogenic and commensal microorganisms and modulating the activities of antigen-presenting cells and lymphocytes. Functional breakdowns resulting in chronic infection and inflammation are associated with the development of hematologic and solid neoplasms for which detailed pathogenetic mechanisms are poorly understood. Mice heterozygous for a transgene Col13a1(del) expressing a mutant collagen XIII developed clonal mature B-cell lineage lymphomas originating in mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN). The tumors were associated with T cells and macrophages. The incidence of disease was reduced 2-fold in transgenic mice raised under specific pathogen-free conditions, suggesting a role for infectious agents. The lymphomas did not express the mutant collagen XIII, indicating that its influence on tumorigenesis was B-cell extrinsic and likely to be associated with collagen XIII-positive tissues drained by the MLN. Studies of the small intestines of transgenic mice showed that the subepithelial basement membranes (BM) were highly abnormal and that they exhibited heightened expression of genes involved in immune responses. These results define collagen XIII-dependent maintenance of the intestinal BM as a previously unappreciated component of immune responses and a critical determinant of cancer susceptibility.					6700	3109	4502	10568	286827	3108	7504	3909	100506742	93978	8993	160728	9045	3117	406	8516	10605	124221

Numerous studies have established the association of MUC4 with the progression of cancer and metastasis. An aberrant expression of MUC4 is reported in precancerous lesions, indicating its early involvement in the disease process; however, its precise role in cellular transformation has not been explored. MUC4 contains many unique domains and is proposed to affect cell signaling pathways and behavior of the tumor cells. In the present study, to decipher the oncogenic potential of MUC4, we stably expressed the MUC4 mucin in NIH3T3 mouse fibroblast cells. Stable ectopic expression of MUC4 resulted in increased growth, colony formation, and motility of NIH3T3 cells in vitro and tumor formation in nude mice when cells were injected s.c. Microarray analysis showed increased expression of several growth-associated and mitochondrial energy production-associated genes in MUC4-expressing NIH3T3 cells. In addition, expression of MUC4 in NIH3T3 cells resulted in enhanced levels of oncoprotein ErbB2 and its phosphorylated form (pY(1248)-ErbB2). In conclusion, our studies provide the first evidence that MUC4 alone induces cellular transformation and indicates a novel role of MUC4 in cancer biology.					5742	55729	8809	4535	10783	6282	6615

Molecular approaches to understanding the functional circuitry of the nervous system promise new insights into the relationship between genes, brain and behaviour. The cellular diversity of the brain necessitates a cellular resolution approach towards understanding the functional genomics of the nervous system. We describe here an anatomically comprehensive digital atlas containing the expression patterns of approximately 20,000 genes in the adult mouse brain. Data were generated using automated high-throughput procedures for in situ hybridization and data acquisition, and are publicly accessible online. Newly developed image-based informatics tools allow global genome-scale structural analysis and cross-correlation, as well as identification of regionally enriched genes. Unbiased fine-resolution analysis has identified highly specific cellular markers as well as extensive evidence of cellular heterogeneity not evident in classical neuroanatomical atlases. This highly standardized atlas provides an open, primary data resource for a wide variety of further studies concerning brain organization and function.					6855	56956	7532	6416	84918	1958	8534	4644	6376	2596	84256	89927	55384	29993	6638	285175	5870	152789	128439	7277	6857	9746	4747	1123	51310	9185	27239	84707	8567	5575	805	51617	90990	6595	80762	6456	26999	815	214	534	6252	23710	119	9747	2893	10815	2891	2904	23349	2892	1114	63908	85455	647979	6262	23017	5566	9568	9881	54461	1804	5798	81553	9143	7345	65009	816	6616	5604

Regulatory CD4+ T cells (Tr cells), the development of which is critically dependent on X-linked transcription factor Foxp3 (forkhead box P3), prevent self-destructive immune responses. Despite its important role, molecular and functional features conferred by Foxp3 to Tr precursor cells remain unknown. It has been suggested that Foxp3 expression is required for both survival of Tr precursors as well as their inability to produce interleukin (IL)-2 and independently proliferate after T-cell-receptor engagement, raising the possibility that such 'anergy' and Tr suppressive capacity are intimately linked. Here we show, by dissociating Foxp3-dependent features from those induced by the signals preceding and promoting its expression in mice, that the latter signals include several functional and transcriptional hallmarks of Tr cells. Although its function is required for Tr cell suppressor activity, Foxp3 to a large extent amplifies and fixes pre-established molecular features of Tr cells, including anergy and dependence on paracrine IL-2. Furthermore, Foxp3 solidifies Tr cell lineage stability through modification of cell surface and signalling molecules, resulting in adaptation to the signals required to induce and maintain Tr cells. This adaptation includes Foxp3-dependent repression of cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase 3B, affecting genes responsible for Tr cell homeostasis.					4733	23258	3688	3662	285513	11145	23191	7494	64745	29997	148867	116496	2746	1493	4609	10924	3685	9144	5714	7074	204851	4925	3480	441168	2982	57205	3094	5710	8676	3735	4953	151742	3559	6451	11037	387751	6775	8829	57231	375	6309	952	5359	3655	2879	5691	822	3604	159	4907	55234	962	23052	55041	8835	64218	3696	90441	3560	191	79026	6095	58528	10971	3682	5179	58515	90268	22807	26519	659	55196	9467	10588	26018	23208	26057	112574	960	50943	6050	83641	254013	84232	79971	22876	157378	7832	8204	10392	401097	7850	5027	158219

ZHENG_BOUND_BY_FOXP3	M1741		17237761	Zheng Y,Josefowicz SZ,Kas A,Chu TT,Gavin MA,Rudensky AY		Table 1S			SEQ_ACCESSION	Jessica Robertson	Broad Institute	Genes whose promoters are bound by FOXP3 [GeneID=50943] based an a ChIP-chip analysis.	Transcription factor Foxp3 (forkhead box P3), restricted in its expression to a specialized regulatory CD4+ T-cell subset (T(R)) with a dedicated suppressor function, controls T(R) lineage development. In humans and mice, Foxp3 deficiency results in a paucity of T(R) cells and a fatal breach in immunological tolerance, causing highly aggressive multi-organ autoimmune pathology. Here, through genome-wide analysis combining chromatin immunoprecipitation with mouse genome tiling array profiling, we identify Foxp3 binding regions for approximately 700 genes and for an intergenically encoded microRNA. We find that a large number of Foxp3-bound genes are up- or downregulated in Foxp3+ T cells, suggesting that Foxp3 acts as both a transcriptional activator and repressor. Foxp3-mediated regulation unique to the thymus affects, among others, genes encoding nuclear factors that control gene expression and chromatin remodelling. In contrast, Foxp3 target genes shared by the thymic and peripheral T(R) cells encode primarily plasma membrane proteins, as well as cell signalling proteins. Together, our studies suggest that distinct transcriptional sub-programmes implemented by Foxp3 establish T(R) lineage during differentiation and its proliferative and functional competence in the periphery.					5889	25831	80055	79720	5733	23224	148738	7128	27086	5295	4214	51761	3097	10659	23220	6718	50852	7535	127124	158219	221336	83641	5128	79596	8289	3612	54491	490	394	54986	10403	4300	6777	5167	84280	9910	57863	7764	3417	11214	5583	10363	5820	91875	2681	201725	51429	5710	58475	29121	55068	5906	9991	9972	91526	2841	1997	22837	3382	340152	474344	9938	969	56929	84230	9262	963	157869	639	25841	11152	3716	4154	23484	4345	10370	79056	6100	7038	114836	3459	5732	9686	785	57102	9847	2892	831	57488	8821	169693	2113	3575	117177	157310	54469	273	256691	85457	92241	114882	51542	55843	2131	55770	120	54518	84298	8428	91612	3572	195814	339977	387357	57231	151888	5527	558	131450	3101	26137	3983	84912	8728	64328	8439	171023	22884	64092	89801	91966	84100	25836	222484	286053	6489	9716	1371	1027	6938	753	8440	56990	7450	1301	8477	55252	7813	678	51311	6696	1326	55824	6775	2035	1876	5033	6672	3458	50650	79668	84419	1901	11174	5930	5925	10892	51735	51762	1603	3720	26018	196	2150	6334	55500	2888	57560	8202	3709	8418	5533	79598	5150	5796	163351	84456	23387	1379	9840	201627	55303	9447	1102	3559	11201	2117	84959	4907	4848	55326	4815	9960	10678	2533	54941	285237	201299	159	7597	9874	9760	221035	9844	116150	483	3437	205717	56829	57591	124626	23097	4539	3655	4729	6402	79722	256380	57507	57698	1179	64919	10225	2494	57050	63892	10455	2820	23522	5987	200424	22890	5305	84065	10516	10283	94241	54149	4088	10365	1524	253832	157769	10243	7048	129685	10002	11315	9962	133121	22800	8829	399	10818	10614	9779	23258	4117	22821	6711	9920	55195	10905	7114	152002	2625	1008	57380	10333	55171	5142	51251	29851	54148	51274	26524	259230	301	55081	3936	23233	55617	5577	337867	10221	5991	22807	54855	28951	9882	1106	5188	55619	10699	6793	169200	91147	23658	55818	30011	23112	814	143684	25998	8916	604	6241	8540	8013	4121	6375	140609	221037	1848	55756	8738	2322	285513	197370	1236	27161	57621	2185	8204	5294	6403	57539	1363	7402	25939	84547	84937	8618	1390	2531	55109	286827	200132	4929	6687	5788	8910	50508	6732	92558	2665	157285	9063	6295	940	10447	285362	4048	28969	868	84671	55636	6001	7006	4217	57162	4068	2004	23143	9521	355	85464	64332	5335	7328	80829	79609	1259	23150	51520	6003	23386	1880	401409	26191	9445	64744	200958	3091	3588	9267	7174	6480	6167	8600	388650	54904	92196	167826	57097	7903	2870	147741	10124	348035	54971	960	57157	6622	64224	29123	5934	23243	25849	29969	64231	84159	29777	10666	25938	81849	64786	55612	81605	6434	9595	79925	79712	54331	84305	3455	55892	1316	2313	10090	2534	3660	3662	113263	100130988	51176	26693	5734	356	7456	6314	51175	1493	5996	56172	80342	5933	596	84722	7155	9448	170575	154796	5682	23499	2565	27334	4249	148867	23329	137835	6304	246175	10096	4193	27075	5588	58513	9639	54499	81552	6504	8835	283777	342035	4988	57545	51000	9712	27244	10767

Foxp3+CD4+CD25+ regulatory T (T(reg)) cells are essential for the prevention of autoimmunity. T(reg) cells have an attenuated cytokine response to T-cell receptor stimulation, and can suppress the proliferation and effector function of neighbouring T cells. The forkhead transcription factor Foxp3 (forkhead box P3) is selectively expressed in T(reg) cells, is required for T(reg) development and function, and is sufficient to induce a T(reg) phenotype in conventional CD4+CD25- T cells. Mutations in Foxp3 cause severe, multi-organ autoimmunity in both human and mouse. FOXP3 can cooperate in a DNA-binding complex with NFAT (nuclear factor of activated T cells) to regulate the transcription of several known target genes. However, the global set of genes regulated directly by Foxp3 is not known and consequently, how this transcription factor controls the gene expression programme for T(reg) function is not understood. Here we identify Foxp3 target genes and report that many of these are key modulators of T-cell activation and function.

Foxp3+CD4+CD25+ regulatory T (T(reg)) cells are essential for the prevention of autoimmunity. T(reg) cells have an attenuated cytokine response to T-cell receptor stimulation, and can suppress the proliferation and effector function of neighbouring T cells. The forkhead transcription factor Foxp3 (forkhead box P3) is selectively expressed in T(reg) cells, is required for T(reg) development and function, and is sufficient to induce a T(reg) phenotype in conventional CD4+CD25- T cells. Mutations in Foxp3 cause severe, multi-organ autoimmunity in both human and mouse. FOXP3 can cooperate in a DNA-binding complex with NFAT (nuclear factor of activated T cells) to regulate the transcription of several known target genes. However, the global set of genes regulated directly by Foxp3 is not known and consequently, how this transcription factor controls the gene expression programme for T(reg) function is not understood. Here we identify Foxp3 target genes and report that many of these are key modulators of T-cell activation and function. Remarkably, the predominant, although not exclusive, effect of Foxp3 occupancy is to suppress the activation of target genes on T-cell stimulation. Foxp3 suppression of its targets appears to be crucial for the normal function of T(reg) cells, because overactive variants of some target genes are known to be associated with autoimmune disease.					316	55112	23526	84255	1615	144108	3192	9918	3783	79137	25833	27335	114882	23741	79019	64105	55823	916	58497	4155	3683	8887	5147	10663	118	26175	89970	3680	29928	51149	222950	51130	64219	1154	124626	2681	54957	10124	51669	94241	113177	27034	2354	9913	28969	79157	223082	10668	1490	51114	5927	23648	84083	10180	64425	374354	11325	29766	129401	51057	487	84294	84335	6375	10363	7518	4437	8784	80774	92815	122769	54494	8473	55916	6484	1385	58486	56252	50809	154661	26122	4092	11152	64754	8916	9931	8710	4355	10476	11103	84230	79834	25821	51306	8301	51389	60491	3313	3964	339977	8969	391123	3685	64981	4292	8289	9712	10044	283742	253943	85395	5896	8339	8340	6789	10569	1959	343521	472	8243	4063	143458	1452	11337	26000	84288	10049	11164	6610	9487	84295	26007	3702	57461	1997	8567	5702	171169	80776	5684	55729	56655	64777	9493	5527	26065	894	8334	116228	51382	54558	84065	366	8370	5469	23169	64215	10765	284273	7525	163590	2633	5586	5710	2793	23765	372	23368	1353	10489	55139	23155	51433	25807	7514	7597	91404	10972	6599	7494	4835	9046	2135	2877	5933	128178	23522	10983	55504	118932	3738	51343	4154	23387	6728	10444	10594	4172	283254	25852	126961	2280	915	401409	115004	11112	27013	9925	23673	2845	54842	1762	79819	3012	29988	2091	3717	8349	8353	11127	643866	4205	771	6774	55813	957	80304	8970	411	387357	5810	10370	200558	53340	5747	55144	2534	23518	147007	8725	54502	285195	4335	5500	91893	1389	84678	162427	1195	2071	51534	440567	8359	9147	55805	5693	84067	2483	29087	81887	29895	3009	5891	84824	163486	9611	9837	80155	6729	54440	8861	392	57456	26973	151295	64359	158787	26959	3428	5412	11221	9528	677	51008	8968	55140	9039	10620	1374	2697	5128	1965	84958	4176	10096	2683	4907	3976	10533	1994	112479	3010	51650	8936	91875	55320	25901	6836	10797	8337	6925	400961	284129	397	3140	79142	80381	8872	84318	23658	388341	535	7993	55329	2005	55236	84305	2182	51322	79735	64285	7090	1270	57118	29081	3017	1362	80013	55004	3832	3013	5573	27306	54918	7112	4194	4609	200205	54556	26073	5525	6426	375035	54331	84312	376132	80232	84419	80021	92170	137492	79612	63915	5597	224	4199	54629	1233	10181	9785	9934	23559	57003	847	1983	84258	5903	25842	3032	4343	53938	1719	285782	7323	26151	2959	4643	10430	79658	9972	1774	54816	6584	60370	120425	123099	9445	1445	53981	148867	9451	6235	220042	3587	7507	9232	8569	55157	54801	26133	10015	54926	4848	1791	23157	7133	146909	7763	64421	10666	8352	2309	23390	1760	8636	3308	79948	1831	64218	10517	1854	54788	64231	55109	10717	6017	1633	9695	7155	7157	6399	197131	2060	8362	26228	29126	343099	5635	79727	8202	167153	9730	1510	7375	7171	83475	83786	202018	8731	83737	55284	8880	388650	6901	27258	5795	4350	23351	1520	84232	10953	26090	4126	23401	23639	10123	26873	375775	83450	5395	1613	7903	27334	285588	8737	2313	2533	9140	382	137835	7292	79949	55593	6898	10626	153339	2936	10058	50999	158248	80228	26020	2916	3020	151194	64795	94107	89978	79096	6804	5531	7174	7403	121504	10956	10808	9453	996	8178	6907	92335	222234	8357	10267	116068	90871	57082	55340	201626	11163	58485	64780	147138	5836	164091	10672	219873	29985	51246	57084	79056	8363	7328	6310	2617	54930	8490	57589	23484	54981	22929	89891	55281	80011	115353	55764	57157	54469	161142	387	23760	23411	162394	9179	5631	83732	5663	114987	5315	3185	353497	7534	55215	127262	54622	51360	50488	22890	26503	6189	55892	22931	3578	23643	284076	1359	140838	79796	51592	3008	9448	113419	5450	9617	5455	1111	91687	9212	5546	4190	10636	11284	388886	137814	9588	10982	1611	10163	26578	2124	7006	7391	23479	5293	8459	2212	5294	55388	252983	23550	5530	8332	1870	219771	388	26258	81603	310	9987	144608	84912	8925	5862	54836	345462	56919	8675	6397	57062	23210	64859	5788	7535	148304	60481	8452	22880	1476	84124	663	2870	112970	64080	55272	84699	29070	3842	729747	51265	6778	27301	85235	27158	2117	5133	1379	256394	644890	5538	10269	140883	4088	9776	348995	9960	55837	54512	7965	220323	57037	9245	79443	79720	26224	8360	1032	6472	11311	1745	5996	201299	27020	11315	2014	54465	57035	1894	23558	51312	10154	80279	6574	197370	84897	9733	24145	64083	26119	115727	10299	8930	3161	22928	7320	23510	7867	379	10902	55303	5001	6009	23481	27115	54664	120935	55233	80762	55920	51163	5110	3146	10650	5445	963	201627	64776	390816	26127	8989	1025	3799	3384	387338	22820	54585	203245	25820	10865	5223	29946	256380	56829	114790	10800	4709	1027	85025	84875	26136	1606	6733	5605	333931	55204	5520	79893	55808	10923	2762	162239	4724	84517	136647	51588	8294	124944	8667	134549	6231	169166	55843	140465	4033	8559	1524	8341	8342	83540	10189	2625	2678	2161	11010	54814	7584	10667	2355	153241	9111	7335	128434	83468	10409	81573	388531	9399	5991	29941	984	9020	7716	3604	91966	9236	7040	8674	282679	27197	81671	2665	9404	89910	27244	160364	23636	285753	79679	1213	64858	10026	384	9120	3398	55200	9555	285172	283991	1643	388272	25913	27173	6464	55520	3720	93185	25949	22809	10330	8335	56006	4774	143888	29777	10838	5163	23478	10194	55299	477	8361	5552	5536	54863	255394	55660	4739	8364	348654	3021	10724	5052	26091	9577	11057	1891	26986	1979	256933	25912

Foxp3+CD4+CD25+ regulatory T (T(reg)) cells are essential for the prevention of autoimmunity. T(reg) cells have an attenuated cytokine response to T-cell receptor stimulation, and can suppress the proliferation and effector function of neighbouring T cells. The forkhead transcription factor Foxp3 (forkhead box P3) is selectively expressed in T(reg) cells, is required for T(reg) development and function, and is sufficient to induce a T(reg) phenotype in conventional CD4+CD25- T cells. Mutations in Foxp3 cause severe, multi-organ autoimmunity in both human and mouse. FOXP3 can cooperate in a DNA-binding complex with NFAT (nuclear factor of activated T cells) to regulate the transcription of several known target genes. However, the global set of genes regulated directly by Foxp3 is not known and consequently, how this transcription factor controls the gene expression programme for T(reg) function is not understood. Here we identify Foxp3 target genes and report that many of these are key modulators of T-cell activation and function. Remarkably, the predominant, although not exclusive, effect of Foxp3 occupancy is to suppress the activation of target genes on T-cell stimulation. Foxp3 suppression of its targets appears to be crucial for the normal function of T(reg) cells, because overactive variants of some target genes are known to be associated with autoimmune disease.					91408	3181	150468	23306	55746	8335	3015	55421	116225	6240	83461	54069	25979	79035	7041	112936	56097	8332	65057	10293	1111	10592	162966	347240	84901	5890	701	55253	143684	4172	54938	5933	22983	27339	114034	4851	6464	3622	1468	63967	6892	51605	113130	4976	64785	27338	93183	51009	9183	6426	55329	28998	10465	55215	58490	8970	23397	8353	9212	22854	9145	11004	1894	7443	8343	54991	140775	5395	6941	56098	11113	257169	123803	9025	29099	55937	2237	259266	55706	57697	51182	55775	55347	51561	4436	8078	10902	51645	399959	25988	144608	4595	30844	9526	2287	5510	8780	51479	3312	55723	57102	8318	55651	51729	9221	57819	10276	3024	54465	4361	8370	29102	92255	9179	90417	23546	51726	54839	10635	8358	84080	10848	10302	4968	84142	23594	1351	84312	8514	9401	57122	51258	55164	122769	201299	195828	4683	146279	29893	25821	401541	6491	23479	338391	7965	113000	3070	7184	83473	79833	84902	7516	10403	6224	3161	81691	92305	127700	55627	162681	8153	148137	3149	91750	3832	55388	285636	6434	54793	29119	55247	79173	11200	23421	54058	84319	283643	55325	8772	8339	8564	25973	25906	8362	6122	197370	10112	25896	151648	353497	5987	1192	63922	64858	51163	6782	57472	6421	4085	5558	55771	8359	26271	51307	55872	11065	10717	55367	152579	55755	27037	6790	92815	4594	83640	3012	23212	145508	10721	27085	154007	1122	9252	22974	1719	6885	79648	9133	4236	92342	51060	1678	9055	3619	55246	9600	5422	53917	147841	8365	4998	8968	25974	79830	57082	4650	253724	1058	5427	157313	121642	64857	11020	8345	29107	80169	9924	51750	126961	9918	3013	113510	7518	79728	51119	8351	79664	51149	5371	147323	83463	901	4116	23398	23310	7840	10572	4176	5591	83541	11335	121504	729533	170506	55737	261734	84930	51602	54821	1786	8352	54107	285600	1062	3627	10298	9702	333931	8826	10238	8329	80308	79677	55299	91057	8334	7314	51194	6772	65123	200081	7508	54487	9833	8349	57650	5757	3835	57117	85235	8350	10420	83443	79135	6553	220929	54862	54443	51340	55010	221150	29074	1460	55722	57827	56942	8086	84919	57456	6502	8666	746	4682	92609	10204	8548	995	890	100131390	6470	55209	79801	7156	152185	10051	117247	10090	27043	9929	55635	150274	113115	5425	90141	8294	10055	8243	55135	7542	4437	6431	83903	318	203068	78995	3014	10493	79751	79003	54955	1479	9493	9733	7884	51634	79019	2957	29922	8317	55120	1633	8438	7023	55732	2175	29843	54478	60314	8344	388284	90459	27301	619208	11073	9156	836	128387	27316	55631	23178	116461	55260	2189	10476	9567	56992	339448	9768	29128	4439	348235	675	699	29109	10460	641	153339	25886	5698	79075	26277	6017	146956	4329	79968	201973	10762	9352	7272	51573	63979	84986	3017	23658	55677	4174	164118	6183	10714	80301	23093	10263	25828	51512	51278	54801	221443	10951	23299	332	993	81620	8364	10772	158787	5984	81608	6189	7153	8357	2820	81555	3018	9295	83879	51023	1163	55143	8340	3838	8354	24137	546	7157	54908	93323	4800	1869	11243	3145	81611	9824	284992	10615	65263	55272	51248	5347	126282	55355	84515	3268	9684	112942	4758	64710	79807	81542	115572	210	2491	10193	29127	9399	27258	64946	9230	554251	26156	80700	80329	4173	56890	84529	580	58496	84516	8361	9419	83605	8554	9738	26145	55831	112479	8355	51264	9656	7374	51026	5430	10849	56943	9700	57050	90416	56252	54797	7353	90637	55166	4891	200558	1650	201475	5810	84717	3837	5471	55110	23746	27079	9125	54499	79982	55165	5965	54962	25936	983	91687	63901	4478	23404	115004	126626	55789	79691	441549	79902	813	54851	51175	163786	57560	2271	126393	23307	5116	6548	80119	23596	5281	4507	10556	151246	25909	9782	6118	10733	140901	10915	1477	9787	4605	6241	8969	134492	51106	84280	9994	10058	26135	204	55322	5824	8618	5902	100131211	6890	50861	81624	57194	10067	10730	55157	8342	3009	23097	92935	10712	90701	55833	5557	10300	10606	11270	4609	146909	11161	64105	115509	3420	80178	83540	7398	9675	6596	990	84057	4218	8630	25852	157570	55171	220134	4751	84950	9126	1317	80217	6929	899	79621	79682	991	9373	11100	9847	58493	79023	26074	55839	9325	51501	348654	7917	245711	79441	85236	51514	57405	8363	2956	283349	55035	126661	83990	56172	9666	4796	5905	23234	25914	1663	221477	85019	78988	10421	8341	23510	56655	4175	85450	9972	3007	137872	54535	440145	7918	6124	4678	79866	6950	5888	8366	10248	130502	79053	51203	23070	84955	6185	8360	2146	54662	55055	91442

Foxp3+CD4+CD25+ regulatory T (T(reg)) cells are essential for the prevention of autoimmunity. T(reg) cells have an attenuated cytokine response to T-cell receptor stimulation, and can suppress the proliferation and effector function of neighbouring T cells.

Mutations in Foxp3 cause severe, multi-organ autoimmunity in both human and mouse. FOXP3 can cooperate in a DNA-binding complex with NFAT (nuclear factor of activated T cells) to regulate the transcription of several known target genes.

Transcription factor Foxp3 (forkhead box P3), restricted in its expression to a specialized regulatory CD4+ T-cell subset (T(R)) with a dedicated suppressor function, controls T(R) lineage development. In humans and mice, Foxp3 deficiency results in a paucity of T(R) cells and a fatal breach in immunological tolerance, causing highly aggressive multi-organ autoimmune pathology. Here, through genome-wide analysis combining chromatin immunoprecipitation with mouse genome tiling array profiling, we identify Foxp3 binding regions for approximately 700 genes and for an intergenically encoded microRNA. We find that a large number of Foxp3-bound genes are up- or downregulated in Foxp3+ T cells, suggesting that Foxp3 acts as both a transcriptional activator and repressor. Foxp3-mediated regulation unique to the thymus affects, among others, genes encoding nuclear factors that control gene expression and chromatin remodelling. In contrast, Foxp3 target genes shared by the thymic and peripheral T(R) cells encode primarily plasma membrane proteins, as well as cell signalling proteins. Together, our studies suggest that distinct transcriptional sub-programmes implemented by Foxp3 establish T(R) lineage during differentiation and its proliferative and functional competence in the periphery.					140609	753	55054	51000	80205	169200	23548	7597	53840	10678	56929	626	9972	120	10383	9991	7204	6386	6504	64224	26959	10124	2908	10671	7764	7852	50852	23258	55843	1316	3720	51439	7096	7813	29777	23137	51274	1363	678	868	5820	4217	80317	51542	11214	64786	3655	9910	3575	55619	2004	9650	7155	57162	10892	67	4214	4048	6503	84456	29969	79624	1371	5305	3662	221037	10905	1017	114836	3091	9840	11231	5128	9760	5996	9371	54469	490	10659	23387	27244	337867	23253	6775	4154	158219	65125	7150	2841	56829	90416	3097	63915	90268	4121	388650	940	7128	29966	5142	4848	259230	26524	1997	84280	2665	55791	2113	8600	286053	10767	54149	143684	27334	113263	25938	831	246175	8832	84255	5991	25841	2131	26018	25939	6125	523	55972	26137	201627	55617	8202	23329	8821	51762	23233	122830	57157	51735	81552	55003	4649	6434	54941	54206	8693	2150	9639	222484	6717	394	79609	11154	6938	23143	55252	26034	2098	157769	50650	154661	3455	3423	5732	84159	23522	5527	56940	10926	79699	285513	5682	23386	1880	9847	64332	6777	80055	9779	22884	55500	221035	5533	10447	25998	8440	7174	969	5295	11193	10370	10243	8835	55486	23097	4907

The APC gene encodes the adenomatous polyposis coli tumour suppressor protein, germline mutation of which characterizes familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), an autosomal intestinal cancer syndrome. Inactivation of APC is also recognized as the key early event in the development of sporadic colorectal cancers, and its loss results in constitutive activity of the beta-catenin-Tcf4 transcription complex. The proto-oncogene c-MYC has been identified as a target of the Wnt pathway in colorectal cancer cells in vitro, in normal crypts in vivo and in intestinal epithelial cells acutely transformed on in vivo deletion of the APC gene; however, the significance of this is unclear. Therefore, to elucidate the role Myc has in the intestine after Apc loss, we have simultaneously deleted both Apc and Myc in the adult murine small intestine. Here we show that loss of Myc rescued the phenotypes of perturbed differentiation, migration, proliferation and apoptosis, which occur on deletion of Apc. Remarkably, this rescue occurred in the presence of high levels of nuclear beta-catenin.

Precise control of transcriptional programmes underlying metazoan development is modulated by enzymatically active co-regulatory complexes, coupled with epigenetic strategies. One thing that remains unclear is how specific members of histone modification enzyme families, such as histone methyltransferases and demethylases, are used in vivo to simultaneously orchestrate distinct developmental gene activation and repression programmes. Here, we report that the histone lysine demethylase, LSD1--a component of the CoREST-CtBP co-repressor complex--is required for late cell-lineage determination and differentiation during pituitary organogenesis. LSD1 seems to act primarily on target gene activation programmes, as well as in gene repression programmes, on the basis of recruitment of distinct LSD1-containing co-activator or co-repressor complexes. LSD1-dependent gene repression programmes can be extended late in development with the induced expression of ZEB1, a Krüppel-like repressor that can act as a molecular beacon for recruitment of the LSD1-containing CoREST-CtBP co-repressor complex, causing repression of an additional cohort of genes, such as Gh, which previously required LSD1 for activation. These findings suggest that temporal patterns of expression of specific components of LSD1 complexes modulate gene regulatory programmes in many mammalian organs.					3956	6495	1466	9843	4256	7430	7042	10912	4610	29108	6657	898	912	5154	2004	4192	2621	3485	2290	5649	2037	3488	1028	56475

Precise control of transcriptional programmes underlying metazoan development is modulated by enzymatically active co-regulatory complexes, coupled with epigenetic strategies. One thing that remains unclear is how specific members of histone modification enzyme families, such as histone methyltransferases and demethylases, are used in vivo to simultaneously orchestrate distinct developmental gene activation and repression programmes. Here, we report that the histone lysine demethylase, LSD1--a component of the CoREST-CtBP co-repressor complex--is required for late cell-lineage determination and differentiation during pituitary organogenesis. LSD1 seems to act primarily on target gene activation programmes, as well as in gene repression programmes, on the basis of recruitment of distinct LSD1-containing co-activator or co-repressor complexes. LSD1-dependent gene repression programmes can be extended late in development with the induced expression of ZEB1, a Krüppel-like repressor that can act as a molecular beacon for recruitment of the LSD1-containing CoREST-CtBP co-repressor complex, causing repression of an additional cohort of genes, such as Gh, which previously required LSD1 for activation.

Toll-like receptors (TLRs) induce a multi-component inflammatory response that must be tightly regulated to avoid tissue damage. Most known regulatory mechanisms target TLR signalling pathways and thus broadly inhibit multiple aspects of the inflammatory response. Given the functional diversity of TLR-induced genes, we proposed that additional, gene-specific regulatory mechanisms exist to allow individual aspects of the TLR-induced response to be differentially regulated.

We demonstrate that representatives from the two classes acquire distinct patterns of TLR-induced chromatin modifications. These gene-specific chromatin modifications are associated with transient silencing of one class of genes, which includes pro-inflammatory mediators, and priming of the second class, which includes antimicrobial effectors.

Germline mutation in serine/threonine kinase 11 (STK11, also called LKB1) results in Peutz-Jeghers syndrome, characterized by intestinal hamartomas and increased incidence of epithelial cancers. Although uncommon in most sporadic cancers, inactivating somatic mutations of LKB1 have been reported in primary human lung adenocarcinomas and derivative cell lines. Here we used a somatically activatable mutant Kras-driven model of mouse lung cancer to compare the role of Lkb1 to other tumour suppressors in lung cancer. Although Kras mutation cooperated with loss of p53 or Ink4a/Arf (also known as Cdkn2a) in this system, the strongest cooperation was seen with homozygous inactivation of Lkb1. Lkb1-deficient tumours demonstrated shorter latency, an expanded histological spectrum (adeno-, squamous and large-cell carcinoma) and more frequent metastasis compared to tumours lacking p53 or Ink4a/Arf. Pulmonary tumorigenesis was also accelerated by hemizygous inactivation of Lkb1. Consistent with these findings, inactivation of LKB1 was found in 34% and 19% of 144 analysed human lung adenocarcinomas and squamous cell carcinomas, respectively. Expression profiling in human lung cancer cell lines and mouse lung tumours identified a variety of metastasis-promoting genes, such as NEDD9, VEGFC and CD24, as targets of LKB1 repression in lung cancer.

Germline mutation in serine/threonine kinase 11 (STK11, also called LKB1) results in Peutz-Jeghers syndrome, characterized by intestinal hamartomas and increased incidence of epithelial cancers. Although uncommon in most sporadic cancers, inactivating somatic mutations of LKB1 have been reported in primary human lung adenocarcinomas and derivative cell lines. Here we used a somatically activatable mutant Kras-driven model of mouse lung cancer to compare the role of Lkb1 to other tumour suppressors in lung cancer. Although Kras mutation cooperated with loss of p53 or Ink4a/Arf (also known as Cdkn2a) in this system, the strongest cooperation was seen with homozygous inactivation of Lkb1. Lkb1-deficient tumours demonstrated shorter latency, an expanded histological spectrum (adeno-, squamous and large-cell carcinoma) and more frequent metastasis compared to tumours lacking p53 or Ink4a/Arf. Pulmonary tumorigenesis was also accelerated by hemizygous inactivation of Lkb1. Consistent with these findings, inactivation of LKB1 was found in 34% and 19% of 144 analysed human lung adenocarcinomas and squamous cell carcinomas, respectively. Expression profiling in human lung cancer cell lines and mouse lung tumours identified a variety of metastasis-promoting genes, such as NEDD9, VEGFC and CD24, as targets of LKB1 repression in lung cancer. These studies establish LKB1 as a critical barrier to pulmonary tumorigenesis, controlling initiation, differentiation and metastasis.					3853	7074	27076	3852	5473	7020	646	53836	8626	101	1308	5317
GAZIN_EPIGENETIC_SILENCING_BY_KRAS	M1770		17960246	Gazin C,Wajapeyee N,Gobeil S,Virbasius CM,Green MR		Table 1			SEQ_ACCESSION	Jessica Robertson	Broad Institute	Genes required for epigenetic silencing of FAS [GeneID=355] by activated KRAS [GeneID=3845] in NIH 3T3 cells, based on RNAi screen.	The conversion of a normal cell to a cancer cell occurs in several steps and typically involves the activation of oncogenes and the inactivation of tumour suppressor and pro-apoptotic genes. In many instances, inactivation of genes critical for cancer development occurs by epigenetic silencing, often involving hypermethylation of CpG-rich promoter regions. It remains to be determined whether silencing occurs by random acquisition of epigenetic marks that confer a selective growth advantage or through a specific pathway initiated by an oncogene. Here we perform a genome-wide RNA interference (RNAi) screen in K-ras-transformed NIH 3T3 cells and identify 28 genes required for Ras-mediated epigenetic silencing of the pro-apoptotic Fas gene. At least nine of these RESEs (Ras epigenetic silencing effectors), including the DNA methyltransferase DNMT1, are directly associated with specific regions of the Fas promoter in K-ras-transformed NIH 3T3 cells but not in untransformed NIH 3T3 cells. RNAi-mediated knockdown of any of the 28 RESEs results in failure to recruit DNMT1 to the Fas promoter, loss of Fas promoter hypermethylation, and derepression of Fas expression. Analysis of five other epigenetically repressed genes indicates that Ras directs the silencing of multiple unrelated genes through a largely common pathway. Last, we show that nine RESEs are required for anchorage-independent growth and tumorigenicity of K-ras-transformed NIH 3T3 cells; these nine genes have not previously been implicated in transformation by Ras. Our results show that Ras-mediated epigenetic silencing occurs through a specific, complex, pathway involving components that are required for maintenance of a fully transformed phenotype.					2185	9734	283248	2146	4293	10361	23741	170591	84444	648	117608	9866	150572	25842	1869	5170	5594	4591	55257	51548	8726	8403	1786	29063	11176	10664

A series of transcription factors critical for maintenance of the neural stem cell state have been identified, but the role of functionally important corepressors in maintenance of the neural stem cell state and early neurogenesis remains unclear. Previous studies have characterized the expression of both SMRT (also known as NCoR2, nuclear receptor co-repressor 2) and NCoR in a variety of developmental systems; however, the specific role of the SMRT corepressor in neurogenesis is still to be determined. Here we report a critical role for SMRT in forebrain development and in maintenance of the neural stem cell state. Analysis of a series of markers in SMRT-gene-deleted mice revealed the functional requirement of SMRT in the actions of both retinoic-acid-dependent and Notch-dependent forebrain development. In isolated cortical progenitor cells, SMRT was critical for preventing retinoic-acid-receptor-dependent induction of differentiation along a neuronal pathway in the absence of any ligand. Our data reveal that SMRT represses expression of the jumonji-domain containing gene JMJD3, a direct retinoic-acid-receptor target that functions as a histone H3 trimethyl K27 demethylase and which is capable of activating specific components of the neurogenic program.					6678	5154	5947	22854	134637	81848	3159	8572	3162	3482	5502	1995	22980	9925	79006	23269	19	7076	23135	1958	140809	60491	2098	91683	1641	203523	348	10669	55679	51330	63977	55207	1826

Epithelial organs, including the lung, are known to possess regenerative abilities through activation of endogenous stem cell populations, but the molecular pathways regulating stem cell expansion and regeneration are not well understood. Here we show that Gata6 regulates the temporal appearance and number of bronchioalveolar stem cells (BASCs) in the lung, its absence in Gata6-null lung epithelium leading to the precocious appearance of BASCs and concurrent loss in epithelial differentiation. This expansion of BASCs was the result of a pronounced increase in canonical Wnt signaling in lung epithelium upon loss of Gata6. Expression of the noncanonical Wnt receptor Fzd2 was downregulated in Gata6 mutants and increased Fzd2 or decreased beta-catenin expression rescued, in part, the lung epithelial defects in Gata6 mutants. During lung epithelial regeneration, canonical Wnt signaling was activated in the niche containing BASCs and forced activation of Wnt signaling led to a large increase in BASC numbers. Moreover, Gata6 was required for proper lung epithelial regeneration, and postnatal loss of Gata6 led to increased BASC expansion and decreased differentiation. Together, these data demonstrate that Gata6-regulated Wnt signaling controls the balance between progenitor expansion and epithelial differentiation required for both lung development and regeneration.					10690	6139	948	2167	153642	361	10205	4129	133418	1824	114805	79983	9446	54997	25840

Squamous cell carcinomas (SCC) represent the most aggressive type of nonmelanoma skin cancer. Although little is known about the causal alterations of SCCs, in organ-transplanted patients the E7 and E6 oncogenes of human papillomavirus, targeting the p53- and pRb-dependent pathways, have been widely involved. Here, we report the functional consequences of the simultaneous elimination of Trp53 and retinoblastoma (Rb) genes in epidermis using Cre-loxP system. Loss of p53, but not pRb, produces spontaneous tumor development, indicating that p53 is the predominant tumor suppressor acting in mouse epidermis. Although the simultaneous inactivation of pRb and p53 does not aggravate the phenotype observed in Rb-deficient epidermis in terms of proliferation and/or differentiation, spontaneous SCC development is severely accelerated in doubly deficient mice. The tumors are aggressive and undifferentiated and display a hair follicle origin. Detailed analysis indicates that the acceleration is mediated by premature activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor/Akt pathway, resulting in increased proliferation in normal and dysplastic hair follicles and augmented tumor angiogenesis. The molecular characteristics of this model provide valuable tools to understand epidermal tumor formation and may ultimately contribute to the development of therapies for the treatment of aggressive squamous cancer.					10134	2539	4645	58158	7453	649	2568	4734	64859	5660	6123	2819	79603	5768	10576	552	1108	2597	55806	23244	844	8789	51768	55759	10165	140885	351	4076	64108	3868	2932	7351	572	211	10106	10875	3561	23175	89	3223	57045	7122	4247	23529	84932	57799	5010	84272	5108	2040	85480	713	2137	6059	338785	1654	10320	23085	84313	79071	54206	283848	5885	2180	23286	120	64793	4090	10989	9577	51	800	3416	3054	5118	10114	27086	57224	3636	1287	377677	29127	9993	1386	10927	54664	27129	6597	1468	9071	11331	11031	126638	3572	5937	56937	7316	3680	80760	4086	89797	57142	6470	7253	6623	5091	3936	5814	1356	1207	201562	283349	9350	23786	338442	685	894	948	4056	26011	11143	472	814	1277	7027	781	55504	4502	5209	859	337	10193	2524	26959	832	11219	6938	10487	51232	57104	487	858	6517	26086	2954	1981	81669	9423	11154	6502	7076	27230	11152	83641	29922	6659	3481	5105	10672	10057	57587	9659	145264	56729	5792	839	5139	6622	126353	9546	1756	3685	140625	6483	51663	9877	4632	1073	2168	25833	2013	7069	80274	10280	5793	3952	9524	3033	5175	339231	63943	3117	84525	57551	96764	2069	22823	10645	4976	10776	23474	1785	1947	55076	6795	3995	27179	56954	10580	30011	8644	9415	80157	5999	201266	1182	7175	25921	729359	10418	10180	6281	7538	221927	59286	253512	2908	7381	8626	7474	201161	4217	8106	23443	1809	22803	168620	55342	9898	23176	81617	83543	56994	5130	8673	54165	387914	10955	1486	57458	2252	3164	10905	3313	8870	10419	56681	56892	761	64746	3948	55233	5095	9169	2110	4695	89927	9646	972	9736	4486	11343	6445	11222	2868	7018	2695	6490	6942	4624	83982	128338	10343	1675	6046	1523	3963	3619	10956	3216	5611	5046	53407	4696	4688	6364	444	10591	5919	1026	51430	5791	7328	7391	55355	200185	10804	4023	2690	219347	11194	26525	58	51703	6932	417	57599	1001	201475	4826	112479	9982	23452	4905	26574	9444	654817	1292	3987	48	55781	55915	57409	2887	7037	3965	1745	27111	285672	10554	64344	1158	26225	161436	3956	1747	55192	2052	2192	10250	7486	664	3859	124801	7174	10449	5981	83449	833	57630	4673	5339	3609	3174	2739	1497	140890	20	4489	29985	118	4891	5737	344	1580	7352	24146	2199	2167	780	8661	5055	6477	4759	7503	84666	2235	400916	91647	55905	7850	3069	8549	5928	2768	134510	7173	2803	353274	4175	762	2633	816	1362	254228	9452	4682	11333	6236	3337	372	6917	262	79831	6637	83401	7048	2263	10914	5567	64600	4125	55332	5166	3140	4438	116039	285527	8476	79003	6820	3716	2044	4619	55471	6711	253725	55652	5965	552889	9319	10615	9667	85409	116362	65997	4205	10438	3375	5873	3998	65018	4131	7057	1586	55000	83853	23240	288	3891	57223	26985	79870	1843	246777	8557	2745	8740	171177	571	6261	84230	152831	134429	388533	2678	9289	2274	56063	55750	56300	6649	4288	9918	79630	79153	56893	7049	10112	827	5204	7157	84267	8091	634	9902	10652	1956	401548	140460	3158	83607	8879	11274	23760	5017	50808	339324	23236	6732	1058	7458	392	6921	64777	9570	23637	10771	23543	637	3927	9370	6624	7323	4907	2053	126074	6662	1978	11142	375791	10992	2778	3182	10659	493753	64763	55872	51084	5549	116844	64399	5337	10048	4060	6256	60468	7498	30001	5743	28996	2184	7284	8780	2296	23150	6319	28984	387338	1144	6699	358	9488	2517	56246	26499	5648	3212	4698	2729	53345	7038	5916	6117	5784	64925	51274	10611	5575	1054	441282	29799	5176	64219	60592	960	7707	9698	64397	60	1195	3845	54148	11128	5783	9119	706	51109	9741	7078	8581	55176	4001	9349	1413	391	57117	1508	595	6240	5870	6698	3959	10628	9991	4267	8689	1825	647979	6660	6770	5194	10767	8884	9967	29767	1524	9689	2697	3421	439	23683	374454	57018	4482	7355	3491	5226	3205	51701	401152	5930	7465	83850	5530	5178	3423	23070	5446	83549	6185	3872	419	5347	8175	63924	23269	23198	3726	55124	3991	9807	5170	9604	55170	8507	847	8076	3832	51495	55920	334	10844

Here, we report the functional consequences of the simultaneous elimination of Trp53 and retinoblastoma (Rb) genes in epidermis using Cre-loxP system. Loss of p53, but not pRb, produces spontaneous tumor development, indicating that p53 is the predominant tumor suppressor acting in mouse epidermis. Although the simultaneous inactivation of pRb and p53 does not aggravate the phenotype observed in Rb-deficient epidermis in terms of proliferation and/or differentiation, spontaneous SCC development is severely accelerated in doubly deficient mice. The tumors are aggressive and undifferentiated and display a hair follicle origin. Detailed analysis indicates that the acceleration is mediated by premature activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor/Akt pathway, resulting in increased proliferation in normal and dysplastic hair follicles and augmented tumor angiogenesis. The molecular characteristics of this model provide valuable tools to understand epidermal tumor formation and may ultimately contribute to the development of therapies for the treatment of aggressive squamous cancer.					56892	54664	4976	55326	4052	10887	64763	9202	4635	5530	417	26959	10106	5194	3868	6563	9491	4247	64231	80760	3069	29985	4090	140890	7465	4205	5784	4891	7057	83543	9898	664	97	6917	10844	3067	6623	8476	2168	64327	10241	5965	400916	8870	2768	120	3054	1359	55905	6770	63924	23452	6649	392	10736	337	24146	54732	27230	84313	25925	51300	894	2908	83878	8076	761	9217	2778	9577	2697	56954	91647	163	780	4023	5095	3685	3832	211	55076	4724	26253	90293	161436	57096	81617	26086	10418	10280	9993	10672	3033	29110	55872	55170	8789	56063	219347	23515	10776	9547	9991	28984	1580	10165	8661	6502	9071	9784	8626	5575	64219	487	858	57142	56925	908	6711	10057	3854	4673	3164	338442	2633	3158	65220	196	91947	1468	10580	55750	85480	377677	3313	51274	3006	4632	5999	6659	51663	10061	51768	2213	3987	2192	5091	5055	1675	4001	27129	140460	10221	253725	56681	3927	8581	6582	56937	9516	10048	3988	1785	116254	10905	6256	115111	7135	827	9815	79073	27309	6279	6624	493753	4175	55504	6319	5937	23176	401152	6230	832	10573	3561	7539	3936	339324	2739	70	6938	8682	1583	2180	116039	10652	26259	2017	58476	3991	6285	2597	1026	5178	948	90865	51164	11017	713	3212	351	10112	1073	2044	1356	844	5885	1843	3216	10134	10628	26985	6517	126638	375791	3140	23198	285672	56034	140885	387338	2690	2517	9911	7253	51701	25833	57282	51257	9918	124808	29127	10329	23633	5154	3965	57587	57599	8848	9736	55110	112479	64397	4688	64746	467	6921	63917	9415	23549	64925	6445	4056	118	84868	10956	2939	1362	7049	29992	728229	654817	8740	10761	572	637	7134	847	56928	65018	79665	27111	51	54458	7305	5981	64499	23070	9741	833	126353	358	6240	9403	10767	1144	7122	5209	649	4482	3572	3182	23299	6699	11031	5108	1981	79022	5581	2040	55915	11194	7850	670	9452	11219	2263	262	60592	116362	5737	27034	5567	10989	5928	83853	4682	5305	221927	7072	2887	3636	7037	3948	3481	6272	4645	6364	8557	3956	8788	5130	9659	6387	126	839	57117	2954	4759	26355	134429	83641	53345	634	2524	152831	8394	56994	1287	6732	54165	7741	55332	79630	10449	9604	960	145264	7381	781	23529	1028	84327	10611	7045	2353	9332	64793	4850	55000	9698	126074	9570	6117	48	83850	10397	7980	5793	27179	9232	9423	4907	83982	5768	7139	56912	57799	4826	5337	57045	2339	84065	3117	5046	3716	3416	5552	10314	2819	83549	8653	7350	25797	8424	10982	1207	51430	7328	5549	51060	1386	285636	1992	3038	10955	3676	1489	7174	201161	81669	4734	9689	85414	552889	84230	1825	6664	3205	56940	419	55652	3680	344	2199	22803	5052	56300	23760	5743	10320	1337	196403	5105	567	8048	51495	859	26525	60	91543	64600	374454	51499	2069	1486	23534	58	7458	6532	4580	56729	10193	10114	9530	5873	5660	5169	157506	64094	26225	3491	11152	50808	84720	283927	5792	5170	2110	8091	972	55848	10659	1523	439	685	441282	26499	30011	9807	5308	7069	4060	54700	10927	3337	56246	444	144363	140459	8879	10914	6932	5204	552	57727	4076	9902	10417	7048	7547	10180	84932	353274	5803	83706	1158	55176	9877	3421	7391	241	6418	7130	3609	8509	23637	7042	5175	23443	10875	80274	5919	9173	10099	4856	116844	56951	372	3908	3845	64859	2098	5446	4481	762	1654	1809	3929	4905	2184	8439	8644	9646	83943	23683	4199	55471	7323	92906	2235	10615	2013	196383	1215	814	7018	23786	186	5010	57862	79831	55233	64344	1855	3002	9319	53346	160	3998	11222	2745	128338	6483	5176	2532	7453	4131	388533	57104	7352	5540

Squamous cell carcinomas (SCC) represent the most aggressive type of nonmelanoma skin cancer. Although little is known about the causal alterations of SCCs, in organ-transplanted patients the E7 and E6 oncogenes of human papillomavirus, targeting the p53- and pRb-dependent pathways, have been widely involved. Here, we report the functional consequences of the simultaneous elimination of Trp53 and retinoblastoma (Rb) genes in epidermis using Cre-loxP system. Loss of p53, but not pRb, produces spontaneous tumor development, indicating that p53 is the predominant tumor suppressor acting in mouse epidermis. Although the simultaneous inactivation of pRb and p53 does not aggravate the phenotype observed in Rb-deficient epidermis in terms of proliferation and/or differentiation, spontaneous SCC development is severely accelerated in doubly deficient mice. The tumors are aggressive and undifferentiated and display a hair follicle origin. Detailed analysis indicates that the acceleration is mediated by premature activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor/Akt pathway, resulting in increased proliferation in normal and dysplastic hair follicles and augmented tumor angiogenesis. The molecular characteristics of this model provide valuable tools to understand epidermal tumor formation and may ultimately contribute to the development of therapies for the treatment of aggressive squamous cancer.					5362	8549	5178	22928	28989	3882	23240	23635	27232	4170	5783	60468	353323	53354	80781	4619	3911	7062	1182	84560	89927	85462	645638	56998	1054	3375	93974	10804	9569	2587	5318	57727	112802	7072	57409	6942	57224	9980	6477	6144	9546	4696	10591	81855	647264	7090	51523	4605	8689	4247	254950	1638	63943	27433	6202	54816	6637	1191	25805	5339	23534	390940	5792	1001	337976	11331	5139	9967	5611	284996	2706	9547	57018	23516	6230	23644	115557	9319	8673	79683	79003	7421	285527	7078	23435	59286	10572	552889	23598	6218	6470	3963	9868	53828	7067	128977	4774	595	6660	3892	79071	6418	135154	8727	6657	339231	6229	3945	4123	5549	1947	23446	6692	337879	2619	11094	4238	1889	79784	6768	3891	23286	1028	79603	196383	9918	57591	440021	7503	84666	140890	83896	10180	337972	3646	10075	5226	64925	8788	351	3268	6046	176	800	9112	3710	122704	55192	4086	150678	56893	10771	10409	65997	6154	162427	4621	7038	29799	8492	4488	144321	10419	2739	8099	85290	9169	3726	816	9455	10658	79153	2052	70	23396	3884	80157	58158	6274	60490	55124	4217	4212	4288	29911	80063	7175	79716	5819	894	57722	1428	2201	56937	10898	64102	27327	4851	9289	3883	9091	29841	6123	9423	55507	9119	1299	246777	1207	6830	55342	57451	1523	23250	10487	284110	3898	8175	55781	25800	9414	7741	571	55504	908	54206	4089	140807	6645	125997	4438	7707	218	6662	54148	1745	7134	1277	10081	4052	11143	57223	5352	84128	5017	5080	6603	64399	6236	10418	4756	11333	64763	3908	3422	10972	1292	203522	1978	84267	9603	140258	83607	5365	57402	3223	7351	25778	22952	64777	2539	10237	23269	6622	168620	3017	5916	55920	51637	7486	22823	201562	4155	1374	81565	57551	124801	1956	64219	2308	387914	201266	3487	4489	8324	283848	25984	2137	57630	8323	5479	8780	55806	23517	5791	2868	6168	1301	57458	3886	334	10907	23321	1058	30001	6261	1908	3927	51435	401494	7173	11128	11142	200185	157506	11343	6428	10250	4926	9343	84417	170680	5310	201475	7378	4698	4082	64784	55364	2334	2316	22868	8507	4134	6185	2203	7138	3609	3485	84272	9524	10887	126917	6222	80114	9507	7337	9716	7538	85414	89797	8880	337977	6651	9202	4624	84525	6597	10576	6712	342574	140739	283349	7025	54845	9351	1051	3885	5430	96764	7355	64108	1586	1413	23543	4695	9349	90417	2006	29767	765	51703	51702	5655	10999	1524	26574	84271	5930	7316	85409	5867	754	7139	4267	1026	339230	55110	3872	7021	527	128178	2252	23244	171177	219699	1108	1468	3980	5217	5621	10749	51300	10765	137392	401548	134510	5932	55759	83401	6586	3881	10672	84240	8106	58480	3157	57510	6155	4125	11081	51025	9794	199990	391	6608	2199	8019	2296	2959	472	4651	1756	337970	28996	55756	65108	162494	647024	55646	1959	9148	1944	10956	22955	27086	6423	10869	79094	5428	54101	2289	123036	7135	7200	51232	124808	23633	3200	6664	4852	5704	811	2803	6795	3995	51109	6698	58530	613	64118	1952	57124	2695	254228	780	4781	126353	79152	20	10645	51599	4502	63917	3431	338785	3265	3619	5449	57127	55355	26011	5730	387893	27123	1747	348	2950	10992	3312	7284	2729	11274	220	23154	23474	288	55471	827	79870	93	7216	6490	7027	6201	2568	10495	79745	54700	79888	4149	2044	466	56853	6227	147183	3423	3887	128869	337969	10554	1497	11154	1195	23236	5928	113419	5118	4053	23150	9488	57410	2058	51084	2678	10465	6059	7474	10438	81624	53407	23085	9659	5814	83449	49856	5870	50805	821	16	5304	57136	10476	5648	8140	4298	9667	5347	29922	8884	389941

Phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted from chromosome 10 (Pten) is expressed aberrantly in non-small cell lung cancer cells, but the role of Pten in lung neoplasia has not been fully elucidated. In this study, we used a genetic approach to inactivate Pten in the bronchial epithelium of mice. Although, by itself, Pten inactivation had no discernible effect on bronchial epithelial histology, it accelerated lung tumorigenesis initiated by oncogenic K-ras, causing more rapid lethality than that induced by oncogenic K-ras alone (8 weeks versus 24 weeks of median duration of survival, respectively).

Transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta signaling has been associated with early tumor suppression and late tumor progression; however, many of the mechanisms that mediate these processes are not known. Using Cre/LoxP technology, with the whey acidic protein promoter driving transgenic expression of Cre recombinase (WAP-Cre), we have now ablated the type II TGF-beta receptor (T beta RII) expression specifically within mouse mammary alveolar progenitors. Transgenic expression of the polyoma virus middle T antigen, under control of the mouse mammary tumor virus enhancer/promoter, was used to produce mammary tumors in the absence or presence of Cre (T beta RII((fl/fl);PY) and T beta RII((fl/fl);PY;WC), respectively). The loss of TGF-beta signaling significantly decreased tumor latency and increased the rate of pulmonary metastasis. The loss of TGF-beta signaling was significantly correlated with increased tumor size and enhanced carcinoma cell survival. In addition, we observed significant differences in stromal fibrovascular abundance and composition accompanied by increased recruitment of F4/80(+) cell populations in T beta RII((fl/fl);PY;WC) mice when compared with T beta RII((fl/fl);PY) controls. The recruitment of F4/80(+) cells correlated with increased expression of known inflammatory genes including Cxcl1, Cxcl5, and Ptgs2 (cyclooxygenase-2). Notably, we also identified an enriched K5(+) dNp63(+) cell population in primary T beta RII((fl/fl);PY;WC) tumors and corresponding pulmonary metastases, suggesting that loss of TGF-beta signaling in this subset of carcinoma cells can contribute to metastasis. Together, our current results indicate that loss of TGF-beta signaling in mammary alveolar progenitors may affect tumor initiation, progression, and metastasis through regulation of both intrinsic cell signaling and adjacent stromal-epithelial interactions in vivo.					2919	5743	6364	6372	4609

We previously showed that transgenic enhancement of histamine production in B16-F10 melanomas strongly supports tumor growth in C57BL/6 mice. In the present study, gene expression profiles of transgenic mouse melanomas, secreting different amounts of histamine, were compared by whole genome microarrays. Array results were validated by real-time PCR, and genes showing histamine-affected behavior were further analyzed by immunohistochemistry. Regulation of histamine-coupled genes was investigated by checking the presence and functional integrity of all four known histamine receptors in experimental melanomas and by administering histamine H1 receptor (H1R) and H2 receptor (H2R) antagonists to tumor-bearing mice. Finally, an attempt was made to integrate histamine-affected genes in known gene regulatory circuits by in silico pathway analysis. Our results show that histamine enhances melanoma growth via H1R rather than through H2R. We show that H1R activation suppresses RNA-level expression of the tumor suppressor insulin-like growth factor II receptor (IGF-IIR) and the antiangiogenic matrix protein fibulin-5 (FBLN5), decreases their intracellular protein levels, and also reduces their availability in the plasma membrane and extracellular matrix, respectively. Pathway analysis suggests that because plasma membrane-bound IGF-IIR is required to activate matrix-bound, latent transforming growth factor-beta1, a factor suggested to sustain FBLN5 expression, the data can be integrated in a known antineoplastic regulatory pathway that is suppressed by H1R. On the other hand, we show that engagement of H2R also reduces intracellular protein pools of IGF-IIR and FBLN5, but being a downstream acting posttranslational effect with minimal consequences on exported IGF-IIR and FBLN5 protein levels, H2R is rather irrelevant compared with H1R in melanoma.					51244	4956	79622	9895	10516	285527	65109	9555	377677	3482	5217	10362	81609

On the other hand, we show that engagement of H2R also reduces intracellular protein pools of IGF-IIR and FBLN5, but being a downstream acting posttranslational effect with minimal consequences on exported IGF-IIR and FBLN5 protein levels, H2R is rather irrelevant compared with H1R in melanoma.					94032	3482	6541	4837	440	1051	30851	55740	378	251	7074	3340	10146	8099	9441	7040	3725	5217	9555	131	2650	2617	4004	7378	7102	815	10516	55	11117	2553	3600	4016

To identify biomarkers that discriminate the aggressive forms of prostate cancer, we performed gene expression profiling of prostate tumors using a genetically engineered mouse model that recapitulates the stages of human prostate cancer, namely Nkx3.1; Pten mutant mice. We observed a significant deregulation of the epidermal growth factor and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways, as well as their major downstream effectors--the activator protein-1 transcription factors c-Fos and c-Jun. Forced expression of c-Fos and c-Jun in prostate cancer cells promotes tumorigenicity and results in activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk) MAPK signaling. In human prostate cancer, up-regulation of c-Fos and c-Jun proteins occurs in advanced disease and is correlated with Erk MAPK pathway activation, whereas high levels of c-Jun expression are associated with disease recurrence. Our analyses reveal a hitherto unappreciated role for AP-1 transcription factors in prostate cancer progression and identify c-Jun as a marker of high-risk prostate cancer.

We have previously shown T-cell-mediated rejection of the neu-overexpressing mammary carcinoma cells (MMC) in wild-type FVB mice. However, following rejection of primary tumors, a fraction of animals experienced a recurrence of a neu antigen-negative variant (ANV) of MMC (tumor evasion model) after a long latency period. In the present study, we determined that T cells derived from wild-type FVB mice can specifically recognize MMC by secreting IFN-gamma and can induce apoptosis of MMC in vitro. Neu transgenic (FVBN202) mice develop spontaneous tumors and cannot reject it (tumor tolerance model). To dissect the mechanisms associated with rejection or tolerance of MMC tumors, we compared transcriptional patterns within the tumor microenvironment of MMC undergoing rejection with those that resisted it either because of tumor evasion/antigen loss recurrence (ANV tumors) or because of intrinsic tolerance mechanisms displayed by the transgenic mice. Gene profiling confirmed that immune rejection is primarily mediated through activation of IFN-stimulated genes and T-cell effector mechanisms. The tumor evasion model showed combined activation of Th1 and Th2 with a deviation toward Th2 and humoral immune responses that failed to achieve rejection likely because of lack of target antigen. Interestingly, the tumor tolerance model instead displayed immune suppression pathways through activation of regulatory mechanisms that included in particular the overexpression of interleukin-10 (IL-10), IL-10 receptor, and suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS)-1 and SOCS-3. These data provide a road map for the identification of novel biomarkers of immune responsiveness in clinical trials.					7099	6778	56300	8600	6773	55540	10333	2826	4600	10725	28511	3664	3552	3824	149233	3428	3002	386653	3567	7293	3561	356	3512	3458	6351	259307	51192	3556	9034	6373	57593	2919	6346	3507	4481	214	7133	6352	112744	6356	55922	117289	3553	3575	6367	3195	3702	3932	2920	3574	64332	3434	8519	10462	3662	2532

Homeobox transcription factors are developmentally regulated genes that play crucial roles in tissue patterning. Homeobox C6 (HOXC6) is overexpressed in prostate cancers and correlated with cancer progression, but the downstream targets of HOXC6 are largely unknown. We have performed genome-wide localization analysis to identify promoters bound by HOXC6 in prostate cancer cells. This analysis identified 468 reproducibly bound promoters whose associated genes are involved in functions such as cell proliferation and apoptosis. We have complemented these data with expression profiling of prostates from mice with homozygous disruption of the Hoxc6 gene to identify 31 direct regulatory target genes of HOXC6. We show that HOXC6 directly regulates expression of bone morphogenic protein 7, fibroblast growth factor receptor 2, insulin-like growth factor binding protein 3, and platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRA) in prostate cells and indirectly influences the Notch and Wnt signaling pathways in vivo. We further show that inhibition of PDGFRA reduces proliferation of prostate cancer cells, and that overexpression of HOXC6 can overcome the effects of PDGFRA inhibition. HOXC6 regulates genes with both oncogenic and tumor suppressor activities as well as several genes such as CD44 that are important for prostate branching morphogenesis and metastasis to the bone microenvironment.					9659	26037	989	6507	64864	266	83875	1135	51135	655

Dysregulation of protein kinase A (PKA) activity, caused by loss of function mutations in PRKAR1A, is known to induce tumor formation in the inherited tumor syndrome Carney complex (CNC) and is also associated with sporadic tumors of the thyroid and adrenal. We have previously shown that Prkar1a(+/-) mice develop schwannomas reminiscent of those seen in CNC and that similar tumors are observed in tissue-specific knockouts (KO) of Prkar1a targeted to the neural crest. Within these tumors, we have previously described the presence of epithelial islands, although the nature of these structures was unclear. In this article, we report that these epithelial structures are derived from KO cells originating in the neural crest. Analysis of the mesenchymal marker vimentin revealed that this protein was markedly down-regulated not only from the epithelial islands, but also from the tumor as a whole, consistent with mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET). In vitro, Prkar1a null primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts, which display constitutive PKA signaling, also showed evidence for MET, with a loss of vimentin and up-regulation of the epithelial marker E-cadherin. Reduction of vimentin protein occurred at the posttranslational level and was rescued by proteasomal inhibition. Finally, this down-regulation of vimentin was recapitulated in the adrenal nodules of CNC patients, confirming an unexpected and previously unrecognized role for PKA in MET.					1002	6615	7291	999	3182	10155	1001	7082	333929

Breast cancer commonly causes osteolytic metastases in bone, a process that is dependent on tumor-stromal interaction. Proteases play an important role in modulating tumor-stromal interactions in a manner that favors tumor establishment and progression. Whereas several studies have examined the role of proteases in modulating the bone microenvironment, little is currently known about their role in tumor-bone interaction during osteolytic metastasis. In cancer-induced osteolytic lesions, cleavage of receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappaB ligand (RANKL) to a soluble version (sRANKL) is critical for widespread osteoclast activation. Using a mouse model that mimics osteolytic changes associated with breast cancer-induced bone metastases, we identified cathepsin G, cathepsin K, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9, and MMP13 to be proteases that are up-regulated at the tumor-bone interface using comparative cDNA microarray analysis and quantitative reverse transcription-PCR. Moreover, we showed that cathepsin G is capable of shedding the extracellular domain of RANKL, generating active sRANKL that is capable of inducing differentiation and activation of osteoclast precursors. The major source of cathepsin G at the tumor-bone interface seems to be osteoclasts that up-regulate production of cathepsin G via interaction with tumor cells. Furthermore, we showed that in vitro osteoclastogenesis is reduced by inhibition of cathepsin G in a coculture model and that in vivo inhibition of cathepsin G reduces mammary tumor-induced osteolysis. Together, our data indicate that cathepsin G activity at the tumor-bone interface plays an important role in mammary tumor-induced osteolysis and suggest that cathepsin G is a potentially novel therapeutic target in the treatment of breast cancer bone metastasis.					710	1511	23358	5270	4322	1513	9099	10600	8754	54532	4321	7398	9958	84669	29761	102	9097	23032	4318	3053	7078

Using a syngeneic p53-null mouse mammary gland tumor model that closely mimics human breast cancer, we have identified, by limiting dilution transplantation and in vitro mammosphere assay, a Lin(-)CD29(H)CD24(H) subpopulation of tumor-initiating cells. Upon subsequent transplantation, this subpopulation generated heterogeneous tumors that displayed properties similar to the primary tumor. Analysis of biomarkers suggests the Lin(-)CD29(H)CD24(H) subpopulation may have arisen from a bipotent mammary progenitor.

Using a syngeneic p53-null mouse mammary gland tumor model that closely mimics human breast cancer, we have identified, by limiting dilution transplantation and in vitro mammosphere assay, a Lin(-)CD29(H)CD24(H) subpopulation of tumor-initiating cells. Upon subsequent transplantation, this subpopulation generated heterogeneous tumors that displayed properties similar to the primary tumor. Analysis of biomarkers suggests the Lin(-)CD29(H)CD24(H) subpopulation may have arisen from a bipotent mammary progenitor. Differentially expressed genes in the Lin(-)CD29(H)CD24(H) mouse mammary gland tumor-initiating cell population include those involved in DNA damage response and repair, as well as genes involved in epigenetic regulation previously shown to be critical for stem cell self-renewal.

Glioblastoma (GBM) is a highly lethal brain tumour presenting as one of two subtypes with distinct clinical histories and molecular profiles. The primary GBM subtype presents acutely as a high-grade disease that typically harbours mutations in EGFR, PTEN and INK4A/ARF (also known as CDKN2A), and the secondary GBM subtype evolves from the slow progression of a low-grade disease that classically possesses PDGF and TP53 events. Here we show that concomitant central nervous system (CNS)-specific deletion of p53 and Pten in the mouse CNS generates a penetrant acute-onset high-grade malignant glioma phenotype with notable clinical, pathological and molecular resemblance to primary GBM in humans. This genetic observation prompted TP53 and PTEN mutational analysis in human primary GBM, demonstrating unexpectedly frequent inactivating mutations of TP53 as well as the expected PTEN mutations. Integrated transcriptomic profiling, in silico promoter analysis and functional studies of murine neural stem cells (NSCs) established that dual, but not singular, inactivation of p53 and Pten promotes an undifferentiated state with high renewal potential and drives increased Myc protein levels and its associated signature. Functional studies validated increased Myc activity as a potent contributor to the impaired differentiation and enhanced renewal of NSCs doubly null for p53 and Pten (p53(-/-) Pten(-/-)) as well as tumour neurospheres (TNSs) derived from this model. Myc also serves to maintain robust tumorigenic potential of p53(-/-) Pten(-/-) TNSs. These murine modelling studies, together with confirmatory transcriptomic/promoter studies in human primary GBM, validate a pathogenetic role of a common tumour suppressor mutation profile in human primary GBM and establish Myc as an important target for cooperative actions of p53 and Pten in the regulation of normal and malignant stem/progenitor cell differentiation, self-renewal and tumorigenic potential.					6017	55166	3077	112574	1191	10592	55223	283349	5947	4240	55143	29128	10615	5888	91851	127281	2819	8577	79006	5426	55839	144455	8835	57211	81848	51203	10763	3978	948	10403	64093	5269	2820	29114	445	10840	83461	182	3422	168667	8503	3491	63979	3835	55313	6860	658	2199	4502	26471	9133	9208	4430	8318	10926	10371	444	4324	2775	9156	8933	10635	10381	195828	6092	6790	3070	54549	22974	595	64856	4085	51280	26353	4174	10252	140612	1910	7368	254263	9936	8323	81620	9833	79180	27254	124801	10630	2181	10814	332	55859	10404	1288	85315	1050	4155	55320	259173	2201	1514	57687	54443	63967	259266	8361	375567	11113	5424	4897	9244	1356	4974	339123	899	144402	8613	5933	221035	4175	23154	51090	891	54997	5347	2823	6538	92369	54587	9768	56998	79801	1164	8870	7079	3092	7088	5984	6240	2048	151246	7083	3487	3597	5214	10487	9055	10212	5015	2237	4067	23424	100133941	7476	84417	55217	7111	79589	5422	2	4172	57122	114907	10797	699	7398	9363	6696	27319	284	83540	4171	1848	5521	9493	7107	30010	10570	23677	29106	24137	23671	390	10184	7941	894	10079	8404	2319	7069	4435	29127	5662	6241	7277	952	333	23321	7153	2560	1846	1854	4678	93487	5575	7378	10733	1666	817	6324	57405	9212	4173	81930	1029	8438	2118	254778	8934	51377	84525	84620	5010	1503	8633	57096	253559	84886	5156	23464	1894	2119	29089	1438	6533	761	991	1163	4001	721	8727	10752	8537	11332	28951	3619	2152	5789	6385	1104

Treacher Collins syndrome (TCS) is a congenital disorder of craniofacial development arising from mutations in TCOF1, which encodes the nucleolar phosphoprotein Treacle. Haploinsufficiency of Tcof1 perturbs mature ribosome biogenesis, resulting in stabilization of p53 and the cyclin G1-mediated cell-cycle arrest that underpins the specificity of neuroepithelial apoptosis and neural crest cell hypoplasia characteristic of TCS. Here we show that inhibition of p53 prevents cyclin G1-driven apoptotic elimination of neural crest cells while rescuing the craniofacial abnormalities associated with mutations in Tcof1 and extending life span. These improvements, however, occur independently of the effects on ribosome biogenesis; thus suggesting that it is p53-dependent neuroepithelial apoptosis that is the primary mechanism underlying the pathogenesis of TCS. Our work further implies that neuroepithelial and neural crest cells are particularly sensitive to cellular stress during embryogenesis and that suppression of p53 function provides an attractive avenue for possible clinical prevention of TCS craniofacial birth defects and possibly those of other neurocristopathies.					5366	64393	900	94241	64065

Infections by attaching and effacing (A/E) bacterial pathogens, such as Escherichia coli O157:H7, pose a serious threat to public health. Using a mouse A/E pathogen, Citrobacter rodentium, we show that interleukin-22 (IL-22) has a crucial role in the early phase of host defense against C. rodentium. Infection of IL-22 knockout mice results in increased intestinal epithelial damage, systemic bacterial burden and mortality. We also find that IL-23 is required for the early induction of IL-22 during C. rodentium infection, and adaptive immunity is not essential for the protective role of IL-22 in this model. Instead, IL-22 is required for the direct induction of the Reg family of antimicrobial proteins, including RegIIIbeta and RegIIIgamma, in colonic epithelial cells. Exogenous mouse or human RegIIIgamma substantially improves survival of IL-22 knockout mice after C. rodentium infection.

Together, our data identify a new innate immune function for IL-22 in regulating early defense mechanisms against A/E bacterial pathogens.					2491	2690	730	93408	23093	2258	2036	283985	9173	29127	6328	56896	25960	55553	79848	117854	3010	79635	56850	27115	133558	23478	8031	1301	6568	7733	6494	5408	9113	6549	633	79723	283659	10562	259266	7024	22899	5940	26190	83871	225	51360
BOCHKIS_FOXA2_TARGETS	M1806		18660816	Bochkis IM,Rubins NE,White P,Furth EE,Friedman JR,Kaestner KH		Table 1S			SEQ_ACCESSION	Jessica Robertson	Broad Institute	Direct targets of FOXA2 [GeneID=3170] in liver, according to a ChIP-chip analysis.	Production of bile by the liver is crucial for the absorption of lipophilic nutrients. Dysregulation of bile acid homeostasis can lead to cholestatic liver disease and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. We show by global location analysis ('ChIP-on-chip') and cell type-specific gene ablation that the winged helix transcription factor Foxa2 is required for normal bile acid homeostasis. As suggested by the location analysis, deletion of Foxa2 in hepatocytes in mice using the Cre-lox system leads to decreased transcription of genes encoding bile acid transporters on both the basolateral and canalicular membranes, resulting in intrahepatic cholestasis. Foxa2-deficient mice are strikingly sensitive to a diet containing cholic acid, which results in toxic accumulation of hepatic bile salts, ER stress and liver injury. In addition, we show that expression of FOXA2 is markedly decreased in liver samples from individuals with different cholestatic syndromes, suggesting that reduced FOXA2 abundance could exacerbate the injury.					729	2520	1399	2180	5445	5147	79634	3257	8608	5495	5166	29984	50808	1964	123036	3418	7159	5973	54828	5202	5036	339122	131669	391107	112936	7023	5699	80271	64979	1491	2710	5352	79054	116461	3030	1280	343	5465	27439	6047	6652	961	9420	81035	5768	5265	5576	57700	56997	10205	350	2875	415117	26061	256394	23710	6773	3697	2165	9785	51084	11012	83641	10978	91966	1933	7407	9445	23464	26272	928	170392	81532	5962	648	10419	1528	114876	6248	55527	9768	84654	8969	348	51085	84720	8195	79718	284439	84934	116832	3827	7770	664	8815	26520	3990	570	4035	9277	3732	9058	57447	2222	131583	10206	28999	51128	3096	56729	93986	5913	391051	7073	116844	8398	91304	8431	2328	442253	3263	1237	84262	57104	7066	9016	65985	79705	348995	229	1717	123	4728	23193	1113	6651	58472	5546	5338	1269	5284	80344	7132	4329	90196	284161	7852	10157	7264	51116	22874	158787	10767	146722	7551	51141	1894	729085	7421	5747	115948	5356	1105	3638	25879	283600	51016	375387	1317	3569	283375	51495	5720	23390	7014	56998	10489	3977	7353	2997	51287	58511	10128	3590	23276	3426	55890	55274	9179	10131	118788	57217	3399	81502	4153	5345	166348	66002	51510	2244	55308	847	1176	19	27247	152503	23660	4958	222658	8459	5929	866	2619	51526	3170	113419	23005	26985	27069	3708	5432	55361	2327	5412	1690	85027	1586	3484	55766	57636	5052	51230	2166	1020	65249	5664	5865	10651	3026	2155	25963	79830	24145	4702	4097	2625	55893	2946	113263	722	216	79810	23580	3029	1300	9166	25948	2542	2919	1571	23135	26030	732	3975	22928	1974	83642	23086	23481	7709	92715	80765	2512	1000	64168	522	83540	9140	83636	283537	284086	267	84524	5468	1659	3248	5187	166824	10153	64081	7975	7365	26091	51573	351	255394	2055	3012	3487	26354	54363	3305	91947	64147	191	25913	94134	3417	79872	3726	259	79575	8204	1154	10400	84333	63979	84964	80178	207	116842	11334	128338	6897	1389	80004	3148	22820	4502	30	1186	9988	9753	10875	1468	1482	51726	8329	64786	54957	1301	4835	125061	115817	8856	116519	1942	1654	4084	949	25942	22903	57678	65983	7276	8864	3818	9246	114569	197	715	4143	1431	132884	2184	54629	9414	7083	2203	6291	7366	672	1548	462	387755	29121	114789	10300	468	9925	11067	5340	800	4253	51274	3572	3949	401546	2151	8813	6539	50856	6144	55281	3081	195827	9636	2859	4695	5105	4067	10246	90627	219621	64400	9588	2551	5591	1603	57223	51635	341	10461	494143	7263	51279	1147	6296	5627	6272	140290	83729	4173	80381	144233

Reproduction is required for the survival of all mammalian species, and thousands of essential 'sex' genes are conserved through evolution. Basic research helps to define these genes and the mechanisms responsible for the development, function and regulation of the male and female reproductive systems. However, many infertile couples continue to be labeled with the diagnosis of idiopathic infertility or given descriptive diagnoses that do not provide a cause for their defect. For other individuals with a known etiology, effective cures are lacking, although their infertility is often bypassed with assisted reproductive technologies (ART), some accompanied by safety or ethical concerns. Certainly, progress in the field of reproduction has been realized in the twenty-first century with advances in the understanding of the regulation of fertility, with the production of over 400 mutant mouse models with a reproductive phenotype and with the promise of regenerative gonadal stem cells. Indeed, the past six years have witnessed a virtual explosion in the identification of gene mutations or polymorphisms that cause or are linked to human infertility.

Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) and Wnt ligands function in numerous developmental processes, and alterations of both signaling pathways are associated with common pathologic conditions, including cancer. To obtain insight into the extent of interdependence of the two signaling cascades in regulating biological responses, we used an oligonucleotide microarray approach to identify Wnt and TGF-beta target genes using normal murine mammary gland epithelial cells as a model. Combination treatment of TGF-beta and Wnt revealed a novel transcriptional program that could not have been predicted from single ligand treatments and included a cohort of genes that were cooperatively induced by both pathways. These included both novel and known components or modulators of TGF-beta and Wnt pathways, suggesting that mutual feedback is a feature of the coordinated activities of the ligands. The majority of the cooperative targets display increased expression in tumors derived from either Min (many intestinal neoplasia) or mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV)-Wnt1 mice, two models of Wnt-induced tumors, with nine of these genes (Ankrd1, Ccnd1, Ctgf, Gpc1, Hs6st2, IL11, Inhba, Mmp14, and Robo1) showing increases in both. Reduction of TGF-beta signaling by expression of a dominant-negative TGF-beta type II receptor in bigenic MMTV-Wnt1/DNIIR mice increased mammary tumor latency and was correlated with a decrease in expression of Gpc1, Inhba, and Robo1, three of the TGF-beta/Wnt cooperative targets. Our results indicate that the TGF-beta and Wnt/beta-catenin pathways are firmly intertwined and generate a unique gene expression pattern that can contribute to tumor progression.					1893	7113	6357	3491	7040	9415	10912	27063	5431	6898	1894	6241	5187	760	113	7846	8829	5155	10376	6297	1075	3561	5054	5557	51617	5425	60	6446	4173	214	6696	6291	5931	1850	11261	6812	79084	8776	100133941	4817	2159	1363	595	573	2199	1652	7052	29127	1490	9551	7141	859	10572	3838	9133	7356	6251	10110	729	5111	9590	3437	857	2919	5272	6790	2778	4050	6091	8313	3149	2822	26585	27018	26227	9957	216	1633	1052	1786	2947	51421	5962	51807	196	5777	6281	79801	2944	3070	3276	4175	4061	3087	7135	26137	84823	3576	11099	7102	9397	4065	2171	3397	4323	890	120	7153	10725	983	4791	4288

The majority of the cooperative targets display increased expression in tumors derived from either Min (many intestinal neoplasia) or mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV)-Wnt1 mice, two models of Wnt-induced tumors, with nine of these genes (Ankrd1, Ccnd1, Ctgf, Gpc1, Hs6st2, IL11, Inhba, Mmp14, and Robo1) showing increases in both. Reduction of TGF-beta signaling by expression of a dominant-negative TGF-beta type II receptor in bigenic MMTV-Wnt1/DNIIR mice increased mammary tumor latency and was correlated with a decrease in expression of Gpc1, Inhba, and Robo1, three of the TGF-beta/Wnt cooperative targets. Our results indicate that the TGF-beta and Wnt/beta-catenin pathways are firmly intertwined and generate a unique gene expression pattern that can contribute to tumor progression.					5155	3491	9628	182	8648	6118	1183	79572	51155	10232	10912	8912	309	6696	4166	5837	7474	1363	26664	9500	2199	8928	23597	2535	244	29766	975	23157	631	7102	2683	8553	5450	53827	6664	1843	54741	2572	445	5045	3589	10825	669	10008	3357	10801	3601	26240	361	4619	25814	23175	3694	7114	8437	5743	970	9046	54898	90161	8313	10099	649	23546	4323	4833	2817	6446	3624	60	64682	7841	11151	5897	4133	3856	1627	3914	2264	8829	203	6898	822	27063	59344	196	6354	1944	2934	9315	8840	9465	57159	1158	1490	7791	50485	4986	122622	3726	5321	23621	1000	860	5431	3688	6565	6091	2004	5955	5054

Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) and Wnt ligands function in numerous developmental processes, and alterations of both signaling pathways are associated with common pathologic conditions, including cancer. To obtain insight into the extent of interdependence of the two signaling cascades in regulating biological responses, we used an oligonucleotide microarray approach to identify Wnt and TGF-beta target genes using normal murine mammary gland epithelial cells as a model. Combination treatment of TGF-beta and Wnt revealed a novel transcriptional program that could not have been predicted from single ligand treatments and included a cohort of genes that were cooperatively induced by both pathways.

Checkpoint pathways help cells maintain genomic integrity, delaying cell cycle progression in response to various risks of fidelity, such as genotoxic stresses, compromised DNA replication, and impaired spindle control. Cancer cells frequently exhibit genomic instability, and recent studies showed that checkpoint pathways are likely to serve as a tumor-suppressive barrier in vivo. The cell cycle-promoting phosphatase CDC25A is an activator of cyclin-dependent kinases and one of the downstream targets for the CHK1-mediated checkpoint pathway. Whereas CDC25A overexpression is observed in various human cancer tissues, it has not been determined whether deregulated CDC25A expression triggers or promotes tumorigenesis in vivo. Here, we show that transgenic expression of CDC25A cooperates markedly with oncogenic ras or neu in murine mammary tumorigenesis. MMTV-CDC25A transgenic mice exhibit alveolar hyperplasia in the mammary tissue but do not develop spontaneous mammary tumors. The MMTV-CDC25A transgene markedly shortens latency of tumorigenesis in MMTV-ras mice. The MMTV-CDC25A transgene also accelerates tumor growth in MMTV-neu mice with apparent cell cycle miscoordination. CDC25A-overexpressing tumors, which invade more aggressively, exhibit various chromosomal aberrations on fragile regions, including the mouse counterpart of human 1p31-36, according to array-based comparative genomic hybridization and karyotyping. The chromosomal aberrations account for substantial changes in gene expression profile rendered by transgenic expression of CDC25A, including down-regulation of Trp73. These data indicate that deregulated control of cellular CDC25A levels leads to in vivo genomic instability, which cooperates with the neu-ras oncogenic pathway in mammary tumorigenesis.					22795	80760	58528	4147	51053	21	9446	25803	8728	139170	5947	338596	8795	8190	29802	1375	8741	9953	133418	130026	9695	8202	79801	64105	2039	20	26355	342898	10610	80326	2	4176	2230	3397	9133	948	285	11010	10391	6429	80263	1894	1777	6319	9439	9955	4289	223117	4684	717	51514	8459	29851	23200	171586	241	30814	51318	3094	84709	256126	4345	5326	64859	219621	5557	1163	6035	1075	3835	286183	59341	200916	26287	79589	23017	11166	10112	2185	55638	4288	9828	64116	220	90	5359	1058	5597	57146	343	4807	8484	894	27232	1952	222642	5029	8993	8839	375567	3070	148327	55937	1840

Immune escape is an important reason why the immune system cannot control tumor growth, but how escape variants emerge during immunotherapy remains poorly understood. Here, we identify a new mechanism of tumor immune escape using an in vivo selection strategy. We generated a highly immune-resistant cancer cell line (P3) by subjecting a susceptible cancer cell line (P0/TC-1) to multiple rounds of in vivo immune selection. Microarray analysis of P0 and P3 revealed that vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) is up-regulated in the P3-resistant variant. Retroviral transfer of VCAM-1 into P0 significantly increased its resistance against a vaccine-induced immune response. Analysis of tumors showed a dramatic decrease in the number of tumor-infiltrating cluster of differentiation 8(+) (CD8(+)) T cells in the tumors expressing VCAM-1. In vitro transwell migration assays showed that VCAM-1 can promote the migration of CD8(+) T cells through its interaction with the alpha(4)beta(1) integrin. Site-directed mutagenesis of VCAM-1 at amino acid residues required for interaction with alpha(4)beta(1) integrin completely abolished the immune resistance conferred by VCAM-1 in vivo. Surface staining showed that most renal cell carcinomas (RCC) express VCAM-1, whereas an RCC that responded to vaccination was VCAM-1 negative. These data provide evidence that tumor expression of VCAM-1 represents a new mechanism of immune evasion and has important implications for the development of immunotherapy for human RCC.					5654	127534	8644	317761	284254	4879	23531	10656	55636	10402	344758	7941	6004	3561	7139	57007	8828	182

Susceptibility to Crohn's disease, a complex inflammatory disease involving the small intestine, is controlled by over 30 loci. One Crohn's disease risk allele is in ATG16L1, a gene homologous to the essential yeast autophagy gene ATG16 (ref. 2). It is not known how ATG16L1 or autophagy contributes to intestinal biology or Crohn's disease pathogenesis. To address these questions, we generated and characterized mice that are hypomorphic for ATG16L1 protein expression, and validated conclusions on the basis of studies in these mice by analysing intestinal tissues that we collected from Crohn's disease patients carrying the Crohn's disease risk allele of ATG16L1. Here we show that ATG16L1 is a bona fide autophagy protein. Within the ileal epithelium, both ATG16L1 and a second essential autophagy protein ATG5 are selectively important for the biology of the Paneth cell, a specialized epithelial cell that functions in part by secretion of granule contents containing antimicrobial peptides and other proteins that alter the intestinal environment. ATG16L1- and ATG5-deficient Paneth cells exhibited notable abnormalities in the granule exocytosis pathway. In addition, transcriptional analysis revealed an unexpected gain of function specific to ATG16L1-deficient Paneth cells including increased expression of genes involved in peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) signalling and lipid metabolism, of acute phase reactants and of two adipocytokines, leptin and adiponectin, known to directly influence intestinal injury responses. Importantly, Crohn's disease patients homozygous for the ATG16L1 Crohn's disease risk allele displayed Paneth cell granule abnormalities similar to those observed in autophagy-protein-deficient mice and expressed increased levels of leptin protein. Thus, ATG16L1, and probably the process of autophagy, have a role within the intestinal epithelium of mice and Crohn's disease patients by selective effects on the cell biology and specialized regulatory properties of Paneth cells.					335	114897	7018	161829	55829	683	5457	149685	51317	9371	7503	5091	7348	84649	948	2167	2919	3952	276	3426	2678	6342	7069	29881	5394	7586	259217	150726	4883	89894	9332	4023	6288	1571	337	5950	151887	344	27253	5733	25963	9842	11113	51156	9370	159963	8907	761	9021	11185	3859	2217	89870	51179	57590	65987	26258	6745	4547	132720	79094	259236	729359	3002	150572	56776	2168	91543	1474	4761	4058	50846	8534	390816	56670	63924	54097	124857	5174	10184	64850	1675	80199	129831	8876	171177	3434	1621	153642	3240	7066	248	54440

Susceptibility to Crohn's disease, a complex inflammatory disease involving the small intestine, is controlled by over 30 loci. One Crohn's disease risk allele is in ATG16L1, a gene homologous to the essential yeast autophagy gene ATG16 (ref. 2). It is not known how ATG16L1 or autophagy contributes to intestinal biology or Crohn's disease pathogenesis. To address these questions, we generated and characterized mice that are hypomorphic for ATG16L1 protein expression, and validated conclusions on the basis of studies in these mice by analysing intestinal tissues that we collected from Crohn's disease patients carrying the Crohn's disease risk allele of ATG16L1. Here we show that ATG16L1 is a bona fide autophagy protein. Within the ileal epithelium, both ATG16L1 and a second essential autophagy protein ATG5 are selectively important for the biology of the Paneth cell, a specialized epithelial cell that functions in part by secretion of granule contents containing antimicrobial peptides and other proteins that alter the intestinal environment. ATG16L1- and ATG5-deficient Paneth cells exhibited notable abnormalities in the granule exocytosis pathway. In addition, transcriptional analysis revealed an unexpected gain of function specific to ATG16L1-deficient Paneth cells including increased expression of genes involved in peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) signalling and lipid metabolism, of acute phase reactants and of two adipocytokines, leptin and adiponectin, known to directly influence intestinal injury responses. Importantly, Crohn's disease patients homozygous for the ATG16L1 Crohn's disease risk allele displayed Paneth cell granule abnormalities similar to those observed in autophagy-protein-deficient mice and expressed increased levels of leptin protein. Thus, ATG16L1, and probably the process of autophagy, have a role within the intestinal epithelium of mice and Crohn's disease patients by selective effects on the cell biology and specialized regulatory properties of Paneth cells.					729515	123207	10781	5187	338391	3034	79029	121227	7276	8490	5166	54834	3304	728294	54532	5033	7412	9677	23517	3490	27229	11339	6819	9073	149603	81831	3507	9984	90416	6422	2188	64848	349633	55256	23314	22824	3021	4780	56977	10891	7157	2695	7062	100129361	440193	619207	115817	817	8496	83640	55466	153642	199786	91433	3712	6446	7267	23339	701	10487	64417	55808	55356	375444	4163	55103	6565	3303	23636	55142

MicroRNAs comprise a broad class of small non-coding RNAs that control expression of complementary target messenger RNAs. Dysregulation of microRNAs by several mechanisms has been described in various disease states including cardiac disease. Whereas previous studies of cardiac disease have focused on microRNAs that are primarily expressed in cardiomyocytes, the role of microRNAs expressed in other cell types of the heart is unclear. Here we show that microRNA-21 (miR-21, also known as Mirn21) regulates the ERK-MAP kinase signalling pathway in cardiac fibroblasts, which has impacts on global cardiac structure and function. miR-21 levels are increased selectively in fibroblasts of the failing heart, augmenting ERK-MAP kinase activity through inhibition of sprouty homologue 1 (Spry1). This mechanism regulates fibroblast survival and growth factor secretion, apparently controlling the extent of interstitial fibrosis and cardiac hypertrophy. In vivo silencing of miR-21 by a specific antagomir in a mouse pressure-overload-induced disease model reduces cardiac ERK-MAP kinase activity, inhibits interstitial fibrosis and attenuates cardiac dysfunction. These findings reveal that microRNAs can contribute to myocardial disease by an effect in cardiac fibroblasts. Our results validate miR-21 as a disease target in heart failure and establish the therapeutic efficacy of microRNA therapeutic intervention in a cardiovascular disease setting.					10631	54829	633	1278	4053	2006	4015	1290	79987	1277	4060	8839	9244	27231	7043	347	1827

We have compared histologic features and gene expression profiles of newly identified plasmacytomas from NFS.V(+) congenic mice with plasmacytomas of IL6 transgenic, Fasl mutant, and SJL-beta2M(-/-) mice. NFS.V(+) tumors comprised an overlapping morphologic spectrum of high-grade/anaplastic, intermediate-grade/plasmablastic, and low-grade/plasmacytic cases with similarities to subsets of human multiple myeloma and plasmacytoma. Microarray and immunohistochemical analyses of genes expressed by the most prevalent tumors, plasmablastic plasmacytomas, showed them to be most closely related to immunoblastic lymphomas, less so to plasmacytomas of Fasl mutant and SJL mice, and least to plasmacytic plasmacytomas of IL6 transgenic mice. Plasmablastic tumors seemed to develop in an inflammatory environment associated with gene signatures of T cells, natural killer cells, and macrophages not seen with plasmacytic plasmacytomas. Plasmablastic plasmacytomas from NFS.V(+) and SJL-beta2M(-/-) mice did not have structural alterations in Myc or T(12;15) translocations and did not express Myc at high levels, regular features of transgenic and pristane-induced plasmacytomas. These findings imply that, as for human multiple myeloma, Myc-independent routes of transformation contribute to the pathogenesis of these tumors.

We have compared histologic features and gene expression profiles of newly identified plasmacytomas from NFS.V(+) congenic mice with plasmacytomas of IL6 transgenic, Fasl mutant, and SJL-beta2M(-/-) mice. NFS.V(+) tumors comprised an overlapping morphologic spectrum of high-grade/anaplastic, intermediate-grade/plasmablastic, and low-grade/plasmacytic cases with similarities to subsets of human multiple myeloma and plasmacytoma. Microarray and immunohistochemical analyses of genes expressed by the most prevalent tumors, plasmablastic plasmacytomas, showed them to be most closely related to immunoblastic lymphomas, less so to plasmacytomas of Fasl mutant and SJL mice, and least to plasmacytic plasmacytomas of IL6 transgenic mice. Plasmablastic tumors seemed to develop in an inflammatory environment associated with gene signatures of T cells, natural killer cells, and macrophages not seen with plasmacytic plasmacytomas. Plasmablastic plasmacytomas from NFS.V(+) and SJL-beta2M(-/-) mice did not have structural alterations in Myc or T(12;15) translocations and did not express Myc at high levels, regular features of transgenic and pristane-induced plasmacytomas. These findings imply that, as for human multiple myeloma, Myc-independent routes of transformation contribute to the pathogenesis of these tumors. These findings suggest that plasma cell neoplasms of mice and humans exhibit similar degrees of complexity. Mouse plasmacytomas, previously considered to be homogeneous, may thus be as diverse as their human counterparts with respect to oncogenic mechanisms of plasma cell transformation. Selecting specific types of mouse plasmacytomas that relate most closely to subtypes of human multiple myeloma may provide new opportunities for preclinical testing of drugs for treatment of the human disease.					3918	51377	1290	2034	22858	3929	4237	27044	11315	5875	7205	353299	1454	3693	7076	6249	79659	5034	4313	6773	5525	1973	5691	5817	3882	2118	7391	813	344018	4072	9855	6590	29089	9238	6356	29760	64320	54496	3486	8534	6768	6498	84171	10026	51726	4609	23779	10221	55035	8976	56940	9500	23193	1292	165	29927	8216	84962	6840	8996	5740	59343	5156	1284	10894	2648	11167	8974	3625	23647	11231	6726	10418	1521	249	1650	81607	1917	1277	27076	55588	708	10551	649	3912	10020	682	7422	9595	10409	7494	28986	79784	8404	4145	3703	10514	79711	2135	2028

West Nile virus (WNV), and related flaviviruses such as tick-borne encephalitis, Japanese encephalitis, yellow fever and dengue viruses, constitute a significant global human health problem. However, our understanding of the molecular interaction of such flaviviruses with mammalian host cells is limited. WNV encodes only 10 proteins, implying that it may use many cellular proteins for infection. WNV enters the cytoplasm through pH-dependent endocytosis, undergoes cycles of translation and replication, assembles progeny virions in association with endoplasmic reticulum, and exits along the secretory pathway. RNA interference (RNAi) presents a powerful forward genetics approach to dissect virus-host cell interactions. Here we report the identification of 305 host proteins that affect WNV infection, using a human-genome-wide RNAi screen. Functional clustering of the genes revealed a complex dependence of this virus on host cell physiology, requiring a wide variety of molecules and cellular pathways for successful infection. We further demonstrate a requirement for the ubiquitin ligase CBLL1 in WNV internalization, a post-entry role for the endoplasmic-reticulum-associated degradation pathway in viral infection, and the monocarboxylic acid transporter MCT4 as a viral replication resistance factor. By extending this study to dengue virus, we show that flaviviruses have both overlapping and unique interaction strategies with host cells.

Correlating tumor cell behavior in vivo with patterns of gene expression has led to new insights into the microenvironment of tumor cells in the primary tumor. Until now, these studies have been done with cell line-derived tumors. In the current study, we have analyzed, in polyoma middle T oncogene (PyMT)-derived mammary tumors, tumor cell behavior and gene expression patterns of the invasive subpopulation of tumor cells by multiphoton-based intravital imaging and microarray-based expression profiling, respectively. Our results indicate that the patterns of cell behavior that contribute to invasion and metastasis in the PyMT tumor are similar to those seen previously in rat MTLn3 cell line-derived mammary tumors. The invasive tumor cells collected from PyMT mouse mammary tumors, like their counterparts from rat xenograft mammary tumors, are a population that is relatively nondividing and nonapoptotic but chemotherapy resistant and chemotactic. Changes in the expression of genes that occur uniquely in the invasive subpopulation of tumor cells in the PyMT mammary tumors that fall on the Arp2/3 complex, capping protein and cofilin pathways show a pattern like that seen previously in invasive tumor cells from the MTLn3 cell line-derived tumors. These changes predict an enhanced activity of the cofilin pathway, and this was confirmed in isolated invasive PyMT tumor cells. We conclude that changes in gene expression and their related changes in cell behavior, which were identified in the invasive tumor cells of cell line-derived tumors, are conserved in the invasive tumor cells of PyMT-derived mouse mammary tumors, although these tumor types have different genetic origins.					25833	10175	10155	9191	9168	818	1655	2197	8325	116173	9533	3093	1153	262	29117	10535	2778	687	6129	9414	440093	26136	2335	5692	10963	3575	6188	6633	7264	10938	4720	10284	10885	4082	56943	27327	6194	5315	26528	9978	118429	9804	56061	11171	55031	8214	10112	528	1601	23476	83860	8667	595	26099	2908	4673	6432	79174	22948	7203	9669	4860	6175	4741	51490	7086	3838	10462	84919	1982	23741	5688	83715	2287	476	26135	9232	27429	654321	4726	5351	6193	6428	22800	292	9097	10923	6776	3182	56342	54881	6164	6794	5091	11188	1163	8662	2752	23521	7431	5194	6850	2146	5058	1975	64710	9045	515	140679	6144	1211	6829	10982	183	39	2775	8519	9526	10054	6128	23091	7414	10410	5333	5709	22821	7879	3312	7184	128	8328	7175	23203	57619	4738	27018	26986	9070	10581	10631	55705	8243	7430	3320	4792	8241	1622	10204	8891	6142	23632	33	9921	5108	6158	55651	4713	50856	25980	7532	6202	4771	22828	6205	6772	5187	498	4493	6210	967	829	10327	6217	57402	5627	6497	3148	1994	6059	3912	6208	54623	5723	51466	4343	4904	1351	3039	6227	54899	8879	84617	7417	10808	10460	10928	6132	64282	25994	5281	310	998	3181	10236	4718	1522	2023	5305	23	5900	1347	1981	57003	81631	51082	23435	25824	8894	2971	5093	51035	119	6156	3157	6201	2746	23360	10664	8624	71	2288	8906	8945	4869	7419	79575	51614	6389	347733	3094	973	204	53981	1382	55095	164091	84128	9394	152007	51184	11328	64105	3295	6155	10190	6184	55324	10072	203068	3308	23412	145553	5573	23413	2550	8636	5411	51286	23468	7045	84661	3091	9334	356	5293	22913	487	78988	5685	2647	8987	55216	3915	10234	3069	6747	3836	8897	5478	4666	3837	3336	2194	23137	54583	8417	6161	11224	3309	6277	10576	5981	6560	23049	23760	6118	6711	1653	3015	9987	8073	6569	11124	5962	10094	4780	6143	27000	10092	8540	7095	25820	26985	51479	1265	54434	339451	55585	23608	10776	6235	5701	5825	22920	50865	3851	713	9748	2982	10952	989	573	84460	6046	11060	302	6181	1733	5111	3843	9592	3192	83461	8031	5683	3491	11164	94103	7458	7936	23365	10376	26018	8019	9255	56888	521	51316	1196	4724	389118	594839	79002	1278

Correlating tumor cell behavior in vivo with patterns of gene expression has led to new insights into the microenvironment of tumor cells in the primary tumor. Until now, these studies have been done with cell line-derived tumors. In the current study, we have analyzed, in polyoma middle T oncogene (PyMT)-derived mammary tumors, tumor cell behavior and gene expression patterns of the invasive subpopulation of tumor cells by multiphoton-based intravital imaging and microarray-based expression profiling, respectively. Our results indicate that the patterns of cell behavior that contribute to invasion and metastasis in the PyMT tumor are similar to those seen previously in rat MTLn3 cell line-derived mammary tumors. The invasive tumor cells collected from PyMT mouse mammary tumors, like their counterparts from rat xenograft mammary tumors, are a population that is relatively nondividing and nonapoptotic but chemotherapy resistant and chemotactic. Changes in the expression of genes that occur uniquely in the invasive subpopulation of tumor cells in the PyMT mammary tumors that fall on the Arp2/3 complex, capping protein and cofilin pathways show a pattern like that seen previously in invasive tumor cells from the MTLn3 cell line-derived tumors. These changes predict an enhanced activity of the cofilin pathway, and this was confirmed in isolated invasive PyMT tumor cells.

Cyclin D1 is one of the most commonly overexpressed oncogenes in breast cancer; yet, it is not clear whether cyclin D1 alone is capable of causing malignant transformation of mammary epithelial cells. Here, we show that ectopic expression of cyclin D1 in benign mouse mammary epithelial cells promotes cell proliferation, anchorage-independent growth in soft agar, and tumorigenesis in severe combined immunodeficient mice. To address the possible interaction of cyclin D1 and c-myc in malignant transformation, we used cyclin D1/c-myc dual-expressing clones, which displayed more aggressive and invasive phenotype than cyclin D1-expressing clones. These data provide evidence that overexpression of cyclin D1 or coexpression with c-myc could cause invasive malignant transformation of benign mouse mammary epithelial cells. Furthermore, microarray analysis of cyclin D1 and cyclin D1/c-myc clones showed that these two tumor-producing clones might use distinct invasive pathways. In summary, overexpression of cyclin D1 may commit mammary epithelia to a tumor-prone phenotype in which cooperation with other genes, such as synergy with c-myc, may lead to a more aggressive phenotype.					3488	4321	64084	5997	8038	50509	57761	2846	395	467	1649	83478	795	150084	2069	3487	90427	7102	3486	374	7105

Studies were conducted to determine whether gene expression profiles following a single dose of radiation would yield equivalent profiles following fractionated radiation in different tumor cell lines. MCF7 (breast), DU145 (prostate), and SF539 (gliosarcoma) cells were exposed to a total radiation dose of 10 Gy administered as a single dose (SD) or by daily multifractions (MF) of 5 x 2 Gy. Following radiation treatment, mRNA was isolated at 1, 4, 10, and 24 h and processed for cDNA microarray analysis. To determine the influence of the tumor microenvironment on gene expression, one cell type (DU145) was evaluated growing as a solid tumor in athymic nude mice for both radiation protocols. Unsupervised hierarchical cluster map analysis showed significant differences in gene expression profiles between SD and MF treatments for cells treated in vitro, with MF yielding a more robust induction compared with SD. Several genes were uniquely up-regulated by MF treatment, including multiple IFN-related genes (STAT1, G1P2, OAS1, OAS3, G1P3, IFITM1) and TGF-beta-associated genes (EGR1, VEGF, THBS1, and TGFB2). DU145 cells grown in vivo exhibited a completely different set of genes induced by both SD and MF compared with the same cells exposed in vitro. The results of the study clearly show distinct differences in the molecular response of cells between SD and MF radiation exposures and show that the tumor microenvironment can significantly influence the pattern of gene expression after radiation exposures.					3569	7057	969	1292	7049	1490	629	3488	7048	3043	3491	684	1293	1291	7042	7424	8519	5054	4940	1282	3959	2537	4982	3433	3990	4088	5327	8848	1958	7422	9636	2

The sonic hedgehog (Shh) pathway is activated in approximately 30% of human medulloblastoma resulting in increased expression of downstream target genes. In about half of these cases, this has been shown to be a consequence of mutations in regulatory genes within the pathway, including Ptc1, Smo, and Sufu. However, for some tumors, no mutations have been detected in known pathway genes. This suggests that either mutations in other genes promote tumorigenesis or that epigenetic alterations increase pathway activity in these tumors. Here, we report that 3% to 4% of mice lacking either one or both functional copies of Cxcr6 develop medulloblastoma. Although CXCR6 is not known to be involved in Shh signaling, tumors derived from Cxcr6 mutant mice expressed Shh pathway target genes including Gli1, Gli2, Ptc2, and Sfrp1, indicating elevated pathway activity. Interestingly, the level of Ptc1 expression was decreased in tumor cells although two normal copies of Ptc1 were retained. This implies that reduced CXCR6 function leads to suppression of Ptc1 thereby increasing Smoothened function and promoting tumorigenesis. We used a direct transplant model to test the sensitivity of medulloblastoma arising in Cxcr6 mutant mice to a small-molecule inhibitor of Smoothened (HhAntag). We found that transplanted tumors were dramatically inhibited in mice treated for only 4 days with HhAntag. These findings suggest that HhAntag may be effective against tumors lacking mutations in known Shh pathway genes.					126917	3897	2297	6510	5332	79153	7732	7503	5015	7276	8497	7425	29796

Multiple myeloma is an incurable plasma cell malignancy for which existing animal models are limited.

Tumors have a plasmablastic morphology and variable expression of CD138, CD45, CD38, and CD19. Spectral karyotyping analysis of metaphase chromosomes from primary tumor cell cultures shows that the Bcl-xl/Myc tumors contain a variety of chromosomal abnormalities, including trisomies, translocations, and deletions. The most frequently aberrant chromosomes are 12 and 16. Three sites for recurring translocations were also identified on chromosomes 4D, 12F, and 16C. Gene expression profiling was used to identify differences in gene expression between tumor cells and normal plasma cells (NPC) and to cluster the tumors into two groups (tumor groups C and D), with distinct gene expression profiles. Four hundred and ninety-five genes were significantly different between both tumor groups and NPCs, whereas 124 genes were uniquely different from NPCs in tumor group C and 204 genes were uniquely different from NPCs in tumor group D. Similar to human myeloma, the cyclin D genes are differentially dysregulated in the mouse tumor groups. These data suggest the Bcl-xl/Myc tumors are similar to a subset of plasmablastic human myelomas and provide insight into the specific genes and pathways underlying the human disease.					65108	29128	5649	2305	2553	3184	9647	790	324	1803	7170	4298	1477	150	5896	2475	7298	9317	3845	10432	6502	401251	161882	283431	10585	5024	116113	92610	891	22949	29015	117178	199786	441478	2040	374907	4800	2059

Spectral karyotyping analysis of metaphase chromosomes from primary tumor cell cultures shows that the Bcl-xl/Myc tumors contain a variety of chromosomal abnormalities, including trisomies, translocations, and deletions. The most frequently aberrant chromosomes are 12 and 16. Three sites for recurring translocations were also identified on chromosomes 4D, 12F, and 16C. Gene expression profiling was used to identify differences in gene expression between tumor cells and normal plasma cells (NPC) and to cluster the tumors into two groups (tumor groups C and D), with distinct gene expression profiles. Four hundred and ninety-five genes were significantly different between both tumor groups and NPCs, whereas 124 genes were uniquely different from NPCs in tumor group C and 204 genes were uniquely different from NPCs in tumor group D. Similar to human myeloma, the cyclin D genes are differentially dysregulated in the mouse tumor groups. These data suggest the Bcl-xl/Myc tumors are similar to a subset of plasmablastic human myelomas and provide insight into the specific genes and pathways underlying the human disease.					1465	9855	57096	3575	51676	202	840	2934	26051	598	90673	54020	8575	57584	6788	23616	56925	10100	676	11190	4794	3927	5089	23787	8728	55704	89765	5255	9820	10217	196527	896	10645	3956	9321	2054	9050	1495	26286	83696

T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), unlike other ALL types, is only infrequently associated with chromosomal aberrations, but it was recently shown that most individuals with T-ALL carry activating mutations in the NOTCH1 gene. However, the signaling pathways and target genes responsible for Notch1-induced neoplastic transformation remain undefined. We report here that constitutively active Notch1 activates the NF-kappaB pathway transcriptionally and via the IkappaB kinase (IKK) complex, thereby causing increased expression of several well characterized target genes of NF-kappaB in bone marrow hematopoietic stem cells and progenitors. Our observations demonstrate that the NF-kappaB pathway is highly active in established human T-ALL and that inhibition of the pathway can efficiently restrict tumor growth both in vitro and in vivo. These findings identify NF-kappaB as one of the major mediators of Notch1-induced transformation and suggest that the NF-kappaB pathway is a potential target of future therapies of T-ALL.					27334	969	445347	915	5897	22800	3398	940	2625	50852	1959	8784	3932	3002	597	1236	9308	6352	7185	3593	6376	5971	1958	84433	4791	3383	3665	3726	3587	942	4792	329	330	941	7535	23462	780	924	917	9760	3001	1840	27040	5896	171558	914	4772	4854	972	441478	7070	1493

These findings identify NF-kappaB as one of the major mediators of Notch1-induced transformation and suggest that the NF-kappaB pathway is a potential target of future therapies of T-ALL.					820	2040	8993	4353	126364	695	1441	340205	4688	4689	1511	4145	1438	1436	1215	54209	2672	3684	7441	8328

Hereditary hemochromatosis and transfusional iron overload are frequent clinical conditions associated with progressive iron accumulation in parenchymal tissues, leading to eventual organ failure. We have discovered a new mechanism to reverse iron overload-pharmacological modulation of the divalent metal transporter-1 (DMT-1). DMT-1 mediates intracellular iron transport during the transferrin cycle and apical iron absorption in the duodenum. Its additional functions in iron handling in the kidney and liver are less well understood. We show that the L-type calcium channel blocker nifedipine increases DMT-1-mediated cellular iron transport 10- to 100-fold at concentrations between 1 and 100 microM. Mechanistically, nifedipine causes this effect by prolonging the iron-transporting activity of DMT-1. We show that nifedipine mobilizes iron from the liver of mice with primary and secondary iron overload and enhances urinary iron excretion. Modulation of DMT-1 function by L-type calcium channel blockers emerges as a new pharmacological therapy for the treatment of iron overload disorders.					30061	7037	4502	3934	3263	57817	1356

Cell-intrinsic checkpoints limit the proliferative capacity of primary cells in response to telomere dysfunction. It is not known, however, whether telomere dysfunction contributes to cell-extrinsic alterations that impair stem cell function and organ homeostasis. Here we show that telomere dysfunction provokes defects of the hematopoietic environment that impair B lymphopoiesis but increase myeloid proliferation in aging telomerase knockout (Terc(-/-)) mice. Moreover, the dysfunctional environment limited the engraftment of transplanted wild-type hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Dysfunction of the hematopoietic environment was age dependent and correlated with progressive telomere shortening in bone marrow stromal cells. Telomere dysfunction impaired mesenchymal progenitor cell function, reduced the capacity of bone marrow stromal cells to maintain functional HSCs, and increased the expression of various cytokines, including granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), in the plasma of aging mice. Administration of G-CSF to wild-type mice mimicked some of the defects seen in aging Terc(-/-) mice, including impairment of B lymphopoiesis and HSC engraftment. Conversely, inhibition of G-CSF improved HSC engraftment in aged Terc(-/-) mice. Taken together, these results show that telomere dysfunction induces alterations of the environment that can have implications for organismal aging and cell transplantation therapies.					6372	3082	8784	10563	4313	3565	55504	2247	2277	4314

An association between inflammation and cancer has long been recognized, but the cause and effect relationship linking the two remains unclear. Myc is a pleiotropic transcription factor that is overexpressed in many human cancers and instructs many extracellular aspects of the tumor tissue phenotype, including remodeling of tumor stroma and angiogenesis. Here we show in a beta-cell tumor model that activation of Myc in vivo triggers rapid recruitment of mast cells to the tumor site-a recruitment that is absolutely required for macroscopic tumor expansion. In addition, treatment of established beta-cell tumors with a mast cell inhibitor rapidly triggers hypoxia and cell death of tumor and endothelial cells. Inhibitors of mast cell function may therefore prove therapeutically useful in restraining expansion and survival of pancreatic and other cancers.					1316	2919	6354	6372	6352	10563	6347	2920

Hepatic injury is associated with a defective intestinal barrier and increased hepatic exposure to bacterial products. Here we report that the intestinal bacterial microflora and a functional Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), but not TLR2, are required for hepatic fibrogenesis. Using Tlr4-chimeric mice and in vivo lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenge, we demonstrate that quiescent hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), the main precursors for myofibroblasts in the liver, are the predominant target through which TLR4 ligands promote fibrogenesis. In quiescent HSCs, TLR4 activation not only upregulates chemokine secretion and induces chemotaxis of Kupffer cells, but also downregulates the transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta pseudoreceptor Bambi to sensitize HSCs to TGF-beta-induced signals and allow for unrestricted activation by Kupffer cells. LPS-induced Bambi downregulation and sensitization to TGF-beta is mediated by a MyD88-NF-kappaB-dependent pathway. Accordingly, Myd88-deficient mice have decreased hepatic fibrosis. Thus, modulation of TGF-beta signaling by a TLR4-MyD88-NF-kappaB axis provides a novel link between proinflammatory and profibrogenic signals.					650	84225	6347	9414	23764	2633	58191	3976	1956	91543	837	6401	8767	6648	55647	7412	64332	4791	8111	4794	115361	1959	10318	9180	2921	7097	9497	958	27289	93082	4891	2643	4792	960	285590	1958	8676	4616	91828	2919	85480	7128	10769	8061	330	56892	694	5791	1435	1960	4804	355	3627	23670	6372	11173	9034	51296	7127	28231	5359	2634	54103	329	2069	151354	2920	5993	6354	122953	8870	3383	5966	6348	5396	23308	80149

Exercise has many health benefits, including antidepressant actions in depressed human subjects, but the mechanisms underlying these effects have not been elucidated. We used a custom microarray to identify a previously undescribed profile of exercise-regulated genes in the mouse hippocampus, a brain region implicated in mood and antidepressant response. Pathway analysis of the regulated genes shows that exercise upregulates a neurotrophic factor signaling cascade that has been implicated in the actions of antidepressants. One of the most highly regulated target genes of exercise and of the growth factor pathway is the gene encoding the VGF nerve growth factor, a peptide precursor previously shown to influence synaptic plasticity and metabolism. We show that administration of a synthetic VGF-derived peptide produces a robust antidepressant response in mice and, conversely, that mutation of VGF in mice produces the opposite effects. The results suggest a new role for VGF and identify VGF signaling as a potential therapeutic target for antidepressant drug development.					5605	2569	4953	2571	3603	6853	9500	28964	22859	1959	4240	1440	1958	5105	6529	4852	3939	9283	7425	1848	4915	5584	5594	2885	4902	23705	1961	2002	7857	4885	7320

Mutations in PKD1 (the gene encoding polycystin-1) are the principal cause of this disease. The disease begins in utero and is slowly progressive, but it is not known whether cystogenesis is an ongoing process during adult life.

We found that cellular proliferation was not appreciably higher in cystic specimens than in age-matched controls, but the abrupt change in response to Pkd1 inactivation corresponded to a previously unrecognized brake point during renal growth and significant changes in gene expression. These findings suggest that the effects of Pkd1 inactivation are defined by a developmental switch that signals the end of the terminal renal maturation process.

Naive T cells proliferate independently of cognate antigen when introduced into lymphopenic hosts. Lymphopenia-induced proliferation depends on low-affinity MHC/self-peptide complexes and on IL-7. To elucidate the intracellular signals mediating this proliferation, we analyzed changes in gene expression in naive CD8+ T cells at different times after their transfer into a lymphopenic environment. The genes induced in response to lymphopenia were largely an attenuated subset of those turned up by full antigenic stimulation, including genes related to cell cycling, whereas excluding genes specifically associated with effector activity. After the initial phase of proliferation in an empty compartment, the naive T cells adopted a stable pattern of gene expression similar to that of antigen-experienced memory cells. Thus, T cells proliferating in lymphopenic hosts do not exhibit a unique gene-expression profile, instead relying on traditional signals for this antigen-independent proliferation; this process ultimately results in differentiation to authentic memory cells.					4809	1622	63979	6453	79621	83461	11163	3688	2534	51522	9516	51744	3117	55276	10460	6590	3832	3512	6240	55630	29969	23191	2597	4616	7171	9002	83463	25932	6392	51186	1891	5557	4173	29089	3003	23433	5269	5885	2146	22914	3394	7905	3835	10549	1894	1031	130814	26608	79026	23589	6094	995	6856	9445	10572	10036	3978	8935	8520	6050	54443	8870	11073	8318	1763	8809	55754	58527	23397	51514	8531	2274	1163	301	3105	8277	4257	962	10370	4172	1111	3123	356	23464	115817	8553	6277	2123	2015	5985	1215	259266	57584	140738	1058	6284	5422	1234	990	3002	983	931	210	6515	117178	3148	4267	7167	4000	27020	29074	6348	972	1154	9787	29127	10112	3676	3500	4502	83903	1033	10437	5359	3956	113130	128239	4751	11034	10682	8411	10219	6451	718	2669	5272	2014	824	212	7414	5901	6713	6443	27346	4001	891	1495	54969	401152	4067	307	2149	54908	1164	91663	2952	4288	26586	8807	3458	9212	55388	55723	3015	9470	79180	9026	26225	302	1509	6790	729230	5412	51014	836	822	6672	3306	55041	332	3958	9055	6007	1843	57697	3838	9319	890	8835	7272	2109	3145	5558	7465	3001	64065	6119	54801	2833	401612	5223	5606	9476	5734	79733	5551	4783	256126	2529	29893	51728	4066	256949	9531	10982	55363	5888	4542	3014	639	9094	6352	7083	2790	3398	2012	960	1471	1535	10007	834	57650	8724	4689	3005	101	158219	6351	1317	6845	5292	768211	7295	5935	51203	6275	4635	860	5133	11004	10733	8829	991	202	94239	284023	3925	55509	6941	5355	3006	221477	22936	968	699	3687	51053	9446	7112	9768	200185	3604	1371	56942	50808	3004	5336	55847	7153	5347	58485	2237	8099	6521	84233	93974	10402	7462	6282	10809	7305	4085	899	3619	79887	2591	3040	11332	29887	55379	1719	56925	9133	8766	122618	9683	4174	1493	8993	23258	100133941	54206	759	10875	59342	152137	80005	24137	4489	760	3594	3559	55320	672	10635	7756	6281	4953	2745	3119	5597	6241	3902	8836	55143	84525	3662	51512	10955	9497	10410	1400	23468	5111	214	10797

Immunohistochemistry demonstrated that expression of IFN-gamma protein itself was increased in the spleen but not in hepatic tissue. These results suggest that the increased expression of genes associated with the attraction and activation of donor T cells induced by IFN-gamma early after BMT is important in the initiation of hepatic GVHD in this model and provide new potential molecular targets for early detection and intervention of acute GVHD.					113174	51156	8685	4283	3119	5696	3428	3429	3705	29887	922	9516	26750	10068	7498	5770	5721	5720	3659	65265	3557	10211	3434	6772	25939	51316	7305	10544	10142	713	3627	7453	3937	285203	3108	7412	2634	4792	1535	4489	6556	3123	6891	55303	3383	388646	115361	7318	6347	1409	714	345611	3572	3430	4065	5698	64332	51303	219972	2919	355	11274	3875	122618	3109	84549	8651	2633	1282	8809	6892	10875	9683	5315	1964	4481	56990	7547	3394	127544	3929	9636	23250	2015	929	2289	3122	7114	3055	23646	6354	202	3665	1520	7033	972	9168	3959	10135	3437	51246	963	9450	5742	6890	3117	5699

Natural killer (NK) cells and dendritic cells (DCs) are, respectively, central components of innate and adaptive immune responses. We describe here a third DC lineage, termed interferon-producing killer DCs (IKDCs), distinct from conventional DCs and plasmacytoid DCs and with the molecular expression profile of both NK cells and DCs. They produce substantial amounts of type I interferons (IFN) and interleukin (IL)-12 or IFN-gamma, depending on activation stimuli. Upon stimulation with CpG oligodeoxynucleotides, ligands for Toll-like receptor (TLR)-9, IKDCs kill typical NK target cells using NK-activating receptors. Their cytolytic capacity subsequently diminishes, associated with the loss of NKG2D receptor (also known as Klrk1) and its adaptors, Dap10 and Dap12. As cytotoxicity is lost, DC-like antigen-presenting activity is gained, associated with upregulation of surface major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC II) and costimulatory molecules, which formally distinguish them from classical NK cells. In vivo, splenic IKDCs preferentially show NK function and, upon systemic infection, migrate to lymph nodes, where they primarily show antigen-presenting cell activity. By virtue of their capacity to kill target cells, followed by antigen presentation, IKDCs provide a link between innate and adaptive immunity.					3821	3002	3004	3824	4818	10219	22914	3001	356	5551	3003	9437

Helicobacter pylori infection causes gastric pathology such as ulcer and carcinoma. Because H. pylori is auxotrophic for cholesterol, we have explored the assimilation of cholesterol by H. pylori in infection. Here we show that H. pylori follows a cholesterol gradient and extracts the lipid from plasma membranes of epithelial cells for subsequent glucosylation. Excessive cholesterol promotes phagocytosis of H. pylori by antigen-presenting cells, such as macrophages and dendritic cells, and enhances antigen-specific T cell responses. A cholesterol-rich diet during bacterial challenge leads to T cell-dependent reduction of the H. pylori burden in the stomach. Intrinsic alpha-glucosylation of cholesterol abrogates phagocytosis of H. pylori and subsequent T cell activation. We identify the gene hp0421 as encoding the enzyme cholesterol-alpha-glucosyltransferase responsible for cholesterol glucosylation. Generation of knockout mutants lacking hp0421 corroborates the importance of cholesteryl glucosides for escaping phagocytosis, T cell activation and bacterial clearance in vivo. Thus, we propose a mechanism regulating the host-pathogen interaction whereby glucosylation of a lipid tips the scales towards immune evasion or response.					7318	8651	1755	7378	9601	2628	5276	7037	384	3109	6352	219972	129607	1990	5698	7367	10665	285193	6566	10561	1520	5696	3106	51316	834	6891	2520	840	3107	6772	64332	3123	163351	3119	567	4067	6372	259	684	4065	5699	30061	2710	10211	7033	2633	1075	3431	3108	140453	7097	1667	30001	929	3868	5265	1504	199

Using advanced gene targeting methods, generating mouse models of cancer that accurately reproduce the genetic alterations present in human tumors is now relatively straightforward. The challenge is to determine to what extent such models faithfully mimic human disease with respect to the underlying molecular mechanisms that accompany tumor progression. Here we describe a method for comparing mouse models of cancer with human tumors using gene-expression profiling. We applied this method to the analysis of a model of Kras2-mediated lung cancer and found a good relationship to human lung adenocarcinoma, thereby validating the model. Furthermore, we found that whereas a gene-expression signature of KRAS2 activation was not identifiable when analyzing human tumors with known KRAS2 mutation status alone, integrating mouse and human data uncovered a gene-expression signature of KRAS2 mutation in human lung cancer.

Using advanced gene targeting methods, generating mouse models of cancer that accurately reproduce the genetic alterations present in human tumors is now relatively straightforward. The challenge is to determine to what extent such models faithfully mimic human disease with respect to the underlying molecular mechanisms that accompany tumor progression. Here we describe a method for comparing mouse models of cancer with human tumors using gene-expression profiling. We applied this method to the analysis of a model of Kras2-mediated lung cancer and found a good relationship to human lung adenocarcinoma, thereby validating the model. Furthermore, we found that whereas a gene-expression signature of KRAS2 activation was not identifiable when analyzing human tumors with known KRAS2 mutation status alone, integrating mouse and human data uncovered a gene-expression signature of KRAS2 mutation in human lung cancer. We confirmed the importance of this signature by gene-expression analysis of short hairpin RNA-mediated inhibition of oncogenic Kras2. These experiments identified both a pattern of gene expression indicative of KRAS2 mutation and potential effectors of oncogenic KRAS2 activity in human cancer. This approach provides a strategy for using genomic analysis of animal models to probe human disease.					1346	80213	7123	7056	6709	8459	388646	57381	5727	92747	2328	4208	651746	2013	6280	2983	29802	9843	1028	4969	2113	212	4050	6929	6649	5500	3553	7078	94	10203	5105	57835	7704	10771	5156	8076	3891	9060	10512	9314	2878	5311	4134	2824	2277	23491	1910	27063	10410	1555	23499	80761	137835	3075	8347	857	1394	54855	216	1356	2294	4005	1036	3489	1634	4066	64943	355	3815	5552	2934	915	1305	477	57007	4016	3240	4634	9823	2332	7037	4792	25932	5414	23705	10631	5919	7903	9467	57045	118429	2037	7074	2273	10565	4624	1160	2114	2746	5442	10266	6622	11318	7422	4256	4629	6477	23173	7414	22918	4616	6279	9341	133150	57716	3040	29785	23328	8577	10857	5947	9370	7148	1281	53340	6909	1039	5954	10875	55076	3202	7153	6711	1009	1572	7139	145781	5218	8482	64231	783	9423	3632	976	79837	1278	1238	5787	55303	2633	7035	5789	9806	6555	4137	7102	2044	1363	255877	115361	4635	3290	7082	4239	255743	5740	286826	4082	51554	8997	65125	2321	4015	50486	4602	4646	4781	8609	5376	6817	627	26137	3572	408	25876	8836	8777	3491	64321	488	2623	4147	9466	5066	1948	23166	3215	27244	3851	5159	57678	10398	114	6764	931	7140	54922	7166	3953	3340	4692	9444	126669	57447	8796	6474	5178	3977	5168	83659	1003	3014	1571	1805	92154	140685	55700	6309	149775	3178	10979	55608	10099	63924	58	23452	761	710	5569	205428	55667	19	6387	5896	1759	8404	5348	51705	7026	2176	6926	11328	7503	2534	7010	9258	57402	8611	2060	7134	8140	8434	699	9750	2252	718	22998	6876	50650	4958	9547	2022	3485	3437	1906	2992	3384	11023	59338	1800	687	3725	6925	27075	79026	799	7450	4091	128989	2180	51109	3707	256586	84787	670	115207	10365	112464	7105	6091	196	4619	9637	123787	3912	2791	663	2035	23462	886	127262	4855	284	4883	1396	6943	8842	229	126	6304	7075	1277	388	6835	1580	654	55824	9588	501	2752	92	5444	3791	7356	1665	6657	669	3080	155	8839	8425	8082	64388	3078	11274	50861	10580	28232	7852	126638	1843	2295	9536	1675	4014	3983	1901	4223	5997	55276	9265	3055	4254	2034	10232	25937	54331	7137	64135	8436	10270	26524	3908	7122	55504	4237	9364	55740	4363	220202	358	9590	4430	5175	3860	11075	59345	2946	2940	9124	5581	59	6332	284119	2719	1292	2326	104	6678	11185	5360	1272	84525	4211	10894	85364	91369	256949	23371	760	11168	2675	8650	9034	5875	201475	4811	6595	859	58498	70	6689	3399	646	6664	419	961	8613	2869	1636	5699	154	3203	7846	2254

Neurogenesis persists in the adult brain and can be regulated by a plethora of external stimuli, such as learning, memory, exercise, environment and stress. Although newly generated neurons are able to migrate and preferentially incorporate into the neural network, how these cells are molecularly regulated and whether they are required for any normal brain function are unresolved questions. The adult neural stem cell pool is composed of orphan nuclear receptor TLX-positive cells. Here, using genetic approaches in mice, we demonstrate that TLX (also called NR2E1) regulates adult neural stem cell proliferation in a cell-autonomous manner by controlling a defined genetic network implicated in cell proliferation and growth. Consequently, specific removal of TLX from the adult mouse brain through inducible recombination results in a significant reduction of stem cell proliferation and a marked decrement in spatial learning. In contrast, the resulting suppression of adult neurogenesis does not affect contextual fear conditioning, locomotion or diurnal rhythmic activities, indicating a more selective contribution of newly generated neurons to specific cognitive functions.					7145	6282	9672	3431	138311	5602	1510	55361	950	130814	10956	84417	10580	377	115330	23710	3275	79745	8338	4791	1435	1845	9846	2039	3164	1785	26524	2217	9915	9314	78990	8751	221120	64782	1856	2180	65018	112939	30851	25876	92815	79153	26272	1727	1649	23646	5837	10106	10140	10809	6988	1850	83877	5154	10521	8340	51181	11054	375035	54857	5900	6285	30827	7008	4826	153830	10912	57804	1464	9507	124565	316	9595	8848	80017	10039	6303	83719	6890	54858	8720	23657	27090	6649	55313	30000	60412	1012	23095	2137	10370	7378	6844	1026	7477	2027	23468	3746	56475	4616	6400	57722	7077	8722	7532	140885	9181	54541	3955	2934	8933	694	57787	2040	900	678	192683	10645	4651	9244	10439	3725	581	26260	6948	208	1185	124976	63874	7832	6141	55741	3678	57537	25822	547	51646	6658	2013	5791	8760	93436	23162	23596	3006	29803	347733	201895	219743	23380	1576	8263	11156	79932	3752	63027	8704	8347	5025	57799	23396	3340	2969	2949	9817	10560	25809	4013	138151	392	5829	10608	578	6275	6892	2907	4917	9869	6256	79837	64393	5526	79041	81848	2052	94241	51278	23176	8877	5768	57104	6281	117	977	6272	196463	8862	6324	1030	6812	9479	28232	199731	80303	5138	4071	5463	894	57153	203	1410	2512	83667	7043	140809	7048	402778	79156	152007	11194	23612

Transcriptional activation of cytokines, such as type-I interferons (interferon (IFN)-alpha and IFN-beta), constitutes the first line of antiviral defence. Here we show that translational control is critical for induction of type-I IFN production. In mouse embryonic fibroblasts lacking the translational repressors 4E-BP1 and 4E-BP2, the threshold for eliciting type-I IFN production is lowered. Consequently, replication of encephalomyocarditis virus, vesicular stomatitis virus, influenza virus and Sindbis virus is markedly suppressed. Furthermore, mice with both 4E- and 4E-BP2 genes (also known as Eif4ebp1 and Eif4ebp2, respectively) knocked out are resistant to vesicular stomatitis virus infection, and this correlates with an enhanced type-I IFN production in plasmacytoid dendritic cells and the expression of IFN-regulated genes in the lungs. The enhanced type-I IFN response in 4E-BP1-/- 4E-BP2-/- double knockout mouse embryonic fibroblasts is caused by upregulation of interferon regulatory factor 7 (Irf7) messenger RNA translation. These findings highlight the role of 4E-BPs as negative regulators of type-I IFN production, via translational repression of Irf7 mRNA.					23621	6635	6424	3199	5257	2167	718	7105	9787	3698	81030	3608	55529	2882	34	9341	890	11061	8935	80114	2138	8733	3882	51299	3671	9636	9984	5888	65109	684	5911	3202	6038	5446	81621	92675	127018	7737	55770	8495	4751	26262	5792	332	3920	1379	3858	481	991	5426	10379	113263	53827	83743	2252	586	7849	1280	1024	80823	4311	5347	100	55629	64764	4860	2634	472	7514	64946	22974	5511	4883	9833	81620	550	6271	126129	2030	55723	27346	81624	8839	7474	64747	1894	2297	83604	1427	94101	3597	374659	11004	11164	4835	1036	83540	7412	10112	1964	4756	3964	3557	648	10149	5445	4071	10137	8614	3400	10982	9823	6284	8536	23643	950	4489	7503	10468	7584	6372	57159	4982	23318	2791	1356	64761	721	56882	65263	2296	64108	715	3161	722	7052	64129	7272	84364	891	5433	2026	57205	5822	131118	9212	5578	9590	1512	51435	84105	26519	4781	2896	6649	115106	9123	2869	5236	4053	6352	3212	10280	22822	10135	10039	51246	27316	3070	8082	56267	3169	8544	10659	2303	4314	5993	5507	54443	4257	994	55805	54108	79589	8434	4502	25975	345611	3959	26271	79987	26009	10312	3433	55109	93986	133418	1212	10656	29127	51053	27293	81029	54529	83982	51253	4837	6772	1200	2878	27086	6899	84102	1429	2633	7057	143686	11340	5696	8520	5810	5883	10460	284273	4061	115361	2717	595	6385	23328	4790	51678	26092	79191	2592	217	51203	7035	64222	5066	2027	340419	6595	5422	5396	3965	22954	7153	11035	23576	8553	2173	7706	1009	8804	10403	130497	91010	5256	7423	6558	115817	2517	5211	10257	567	10419	130589	5025	3430	6632	5136	7025	27244	3398	645	6415	10236	5217	9338	9936	3485	64065	2152	3934	9429	8817	3835	4237	9700	10923	29103	10926	1628	501	8406	23517	4817	8926	5352	9873	79639	573	7056	4692	22834	83451	55312	51703	929	377677	55920	3399	28232	56925	84263	10266	64105	9510	54840	29089	8613	5212	3074	112939	79692	3459	637	55364	55210	55631	27065	26246	3107	10631	90410	55872	2305	10630	25974	10161	11274	5201	5051	5698	51390	10561	10791	29979	26031	6150	55706	9364	29085	3929	10410

Identifying variations in DNA that increase susceptibility to disease is one of the primary aims of genetic studies using a forward genetics approach. However, identification of disease-susceptibility genes by means of such studies provides limited functional information on how genes lead to disease. In fact, in most cases there is an absence of functional information altogether, preventing a definitive identification of the susceptibility gene or genes. Here we develop an alternative to the classic forward genetics approach for dissecting complex disease traits where, instead of identifying susceptibility genes directly affected by variations in DNA, we identify gene networks that are perturbed by susceptibility loci and that in turn lead to disease. Application of this method to liver and adipose gene expression data generated from a segregating mouse population results in the identification of a macrophage-enriched network supported as having a causal relationship with disease traits associated with metabolic syndrome. Three genes in this network, lipoprotein lipase (Lpl), lactamase beta (Lactb) and protein phosphatase 1-like (Ppm1l), are validated as previously unknown obesity genes, strengthening the association between this network and metabolic disease traits. Our analysis provides direct experimental support that complex traits such as obesity are emergent properties of molecular networks that are modulated by complex genetic loci and environmental factors.					25927	10948	6556	6744	6810	9242	338773	10057	11035	25800	118881	64094	3681	9450	6527	1763	5376	5480	80097	9547	9519	10682	90678	1513	641700	22797	340371	2588	4542	79814	440699	28232	333926	6354	389	219333	643008	9497	963	27244	10950	7855	533	7805	79892	1438	7903	719	6578	26995	526	7099	10043	5660	6590	3357	113791	79188	126432	3433	5074	4973	2487	11181	8477	1999	6337	2627	11280	91404	8832	3908	23503	5140	81618	26998	1295	5269	954	2014	1786	80308	1621	55809	10159	8778	3074	199	197358	3382	3936	6533	54209	6793	9508	5613	7533	397	11277	9262	30844	3241	10537	64092	154791	11259	3783	84303	3835	55214	25925	29952	28966	5244	93323	948	5025	64744	63967	400569	393	56265	9934	1508	4322	51733	10588	1040	80114	55203	81035	115677	5327	55638	284119	146198	140825	4791	126364	63924	6546	10095	2782	5997	241	5118	865	55740	51148	158067	26056	201294	377677	90865	151835	81609	3958	6383	1794	219681	10109	63922	28965	79444	89857	5019	2990	81622	118788	2214	79733	170371	84433	56920	53829	968	308	6698	8915	3988	27111	139818	121278	145781	8936	6348	10903	7011	26018	29062	171177	3117	23462	10924	7869	92181	5598	733	116071	80169	3725	4023	7058	23400	23461	23207	5580	10899	339665	10215	58484	7104	4172	3455	6646	127495	84188	64174	55723	56941	3856	874	144110	3875	27018	633	10916	3990	1468	714	9308	79567	7490	5159	112	4125	219855	29763	94240	9909	952	339	29957	66002	4147	387521	390790	1512	5971	4643	1728	27286	6775	54863	8728	4814	55361	9145	9338	5493	122618	409	51313	51225	467	219699	441024	54103	51582	3084	9948	60681	10287	27232	55331	51199	65061	651746	83593	129804	342184	254439	10788	1234	1291	84329	8934	23786	10156	345651	83982	100271873	1809	2492	1847	5788	51291	2109	93517	4314	23646	7091	79155	3995	10870	7041	7163	3689	11031	54558	79931	7097	79621	23753	23597	27429	1058	50944	4126	9843	95	30846	51181	10152	29	3897	54908	94031	3937	2037	55092	170482	84868	4488	113277	122786	6050	10661	84102	2353	4360	57604	388591	2628	219983	389840	54978	1031	4327	284207	9641	55034	55803	4361	7448	1636	3483	6850	89886	94	11228	55127	2822	4033	84985	8638	2150	1503	427	7462	79709	23216	3437	51177	116255	8867	2591	10631	92922	51188	822	64699	63901	10261	84187	3059	57381	9454	375387	58510	7105	29990	27090	79668	2209	9573	64285	25790	55884	808	883	7371	91010	53637	151126	340348	79845	3275	26191	55848	53827	2307	83892	10634	55825	113189	5453	8655	125488	6535	2273	23564	4938	79669	116496	133022	3485	8301	6813	84617	3394	55186	5360	51266	3371	10318	191	646174	100134934	1289	1633	80896	23191	890	8674	7223	2316	71	9358	124739	5552	51278	8460	8804	23187	2937	170392	6121	6709	84954	145482	2882	3903	125058	7127	219931	81031	2784	91283	1774	141	390059	81624	57185	200734	2920	338322	10093	83959	7170	5739	56944	3135	23179	7296	340543	84722	80031	63940	55061	3687	338949	6001	4000	168667	81552	9473	10008	5973	8529	79917	9173	90060	121599	79596	85403	51726	11182	10868	54810	23136	4064	1269	1149	1282	10864	196383	972	91828	51284	25847	5196	4066	10998	10457	114836	5547	57664	143903	145226	26872	26090	101	2059	3587	93185	93664	11186	154214	11061	1188	9046	4188	1001	79644	4015	6642	5157	11285	10382	8303	9331	3101	4650	22821	81688	56834	728597	528	51131	84909	3099	56125	100507055	922	5880	58475	91574	6282	6752	29940	8317	23052	9489	161145	9715	23546	7083	5315	2896	23731	90527	5641	942	5479	80148	55501	835	9993	5111	79728	83643	53346	161742	9935	9057	140809	55691	3163	23466	203	8291	151742	5365	9823	23363	6678	4481	55843	2212	10437	3428	25939	10493	8428	9582	1326	57804	435	26750	51479	84247	153020	6508	80709	30008	5732	85461	55577	5900	84632	203328	4616	1290	9294	51397	64115	4739	2035	134957	63906	10336	5336	25816	79415	2160	22954	9404	5783	114990	284021	29902	5714	10749	26053	8682	57198	29967	6272	51776	150290	221	54466	29108	54756	1441	3590	6517	23406	245972	11346	284996	9253	440435	84689	144165	4016	6279	5305	645	79589	337972	8572	57333	54478	3588	54587	11344	131408	2274	57559	2185	7289	11230	221074	11117	420	3090	138429	84141	23308	51053	83552	79971	84803	83937	1462	2687	824	64231	571	4052	2281	9023	6855	4054	10290	732	2720	57460	6510	5031	6611	27303	713	6452	5866	56654	10327	54947	54453	140688	283	54972	26509	9144	81620	2650	55332	58497	27131	53	376267	1959	4321	6672	338339	83461	140876	4174	7006	1476	388325	9619	9595	10257	200008	55970	57555	54498	57698	7043	255809	2824	84270	64168	161247	1520	22848	617	124460	123920	79899	79085	685	3034	22856	8877	285525	497189	51490	5066	7124	5862	7114	51412	9319	150372	10636	84083	2705	64794	10186	432	84290	27433	396	126526	644	2162	200159	84071	6812	5654	54458	51537	10538	55529	2643	79734	84069	4060	9514	51393	51379	9509	6502	23105	56659	290	10767	53842	5341	130940	285195	8784	6624	552	26578	4237	928	401409	23213	84962	4644	29992	29102	5827	29760	9258	90355	26119	1741	27128	11240	11126	7318	10673	9034	10096	113828	10577	5359	5996	27071	401494	51347	307	7454	5832	84168	84858	23526	953	2123	221154	51540	51762	255231	8704	5770	2322	340156	59342	51097	4240	2155	5199	6347	79637	79792	2009	55509	136319	3920	151056	1072	1384

Understanding the molecular underpinnings of cancer is of critical importance to the development of targeted intervention strategies. Identification of such targets, however, is notoriously difficult and unpredictable. Malignant cell transformation requires the cooperation of a few oncogenic mutations that cause substantial reorganization of many cell features and induce complex changes in gene expression patterns. Genes critical to this multifaceted cellular phenotype have therefore only been identified after signalling pathway analysis or on an ad hoc basis. Our observations that cell transformation by cooperating oncogenic lesions depends on synergistic modulation of downstream signalling circuitry suggest that malignant transformation is a highly cooperative process, involving synergy at multiple levels of regulation, including gene expression. Here we show that a large proportion of genes controlled synergistically by loss-of-function p53 and Ras activation are critical to the malignant state of murine and human colon cells. Notably, 14 out of 24 'cooperation response genes' were found to contribute to tumour formation in gene perturbation experiments. In contrast, only 1 in 14 perturbations of the genes responding in a non-synergistic manner had a similar effect. Synergistic control of gene expression by oncogenic mutations thus emerges as an underlying key to malignancy, and provides an attractive rationale for identifying intervention targets in gene networks downstream of oncogenic gain- and loss-of-function mutations.					220323	6611	5055	23705	7941	29780	8091	8482	2027	56172	344758	29088	1839	2919	2252	64411	6649	27063	7139	6563	51316	3576	79047	5997	2150	8534

Synergistic control of gene expression by oncogenic mutations thus emerges as an underlying key to malignancy, and provides an attractive rationale for identifying intervention targets in gene networks downstream of oncogenic gain- and loss-of-function mutations.					18	23493	146862	1993	10966	128853	1606	56475	84552	3398	19	11000	341116	55800	1604	26960	5308	25801	2048	3945	57509	6304	10205	83715	1299	6423	84253	8532	387496	5360	1612	4125	55859	8817	8784	1159	355	25946	3485	83478	4324	84898	5592	85458	3714	3229	5587	374897	3400	5925	223117	7483	64065	5366	4162	56154	55212	80206	81551	10742	10396	81607	388228	143098	4854	1677	79603

Somatic cells can be reprogrammed to a pluripotent state through the ectopic expression of defined transcription factors. Understanding the mechanism and kinetics of this transformation may shed light on the nature of developmental potency and suggest strategies with improved efficiency or safety. Here we report an integrative genomic analysis of reprogramming of mouse fibroblasts and B lymphocytes. Lineage-committed cells show a complex response to the ectopic expression involving induction of genes downstream of individual reprogramming factors. Fully reprogrammed cells show gene expression and epigenetic states that are highly similar to embryonic stem cells. In contrast, stable partially reprogrammed cell lines show reactivation of a distinctive subset of stem-cell-related genes, incomplete repression of lineage-specifying transcription factors, and DNA hypermethylation at pluripotency-related loci. These observations suggest that some cells may become trapped in partially reprogrammed states owing to incomplete repression of transcription factors, and that DNA de-methylation is an inefficient step in the transition to pluripotency. We demonstrate that RNA inhibition of transcription factors can facilitate reprogramming, and that treatment with DNA methyltransferase inhibitors can improve the overall efficiency of the reprogramming process.					29947	132625	9070	891	340168	79923	6997	79723	23522	23492	79727

DNA methylation is essential for normal development and has been implicated in many pathologies including cancer. Our knowledge about the genome-wide distribution of DNA methylation, how it changes during cellular differentiation and how it relates to histone methylation and other chromatin modifications in mammals remains limited. Here we report the generation and analysis of genome-scale DNA methylation profiles at nucleotide resolution in mammalian cells. Using high-throughput reduced representation bisulphite sequencing and single-molecule-based sequencing, we generated DNA methylation maps covering most CpG islands, and a representative sampling of conserved non-coding elements, transposons and other genomic features, for mouse embryonic stem cells, embryonic-stem-cell-derived and primary neural cells, and eight other primary tissues. Several key findings emerge from the data. First, DNA methylation patterns are better correlated with histone methylation patterns than with the underlying genome sequence context. Second, methylation of CpGs are dynamic epigenetic marks that undergo extensive changes during cellular differentiation, particularly in regulatory regions outside of core promoters. Third, analysis of embryonic-stem-cell-derived and primary cells reveals that 'weak' CpG islands associated with a specific set of developmentally regulated genes undergo aberrant hypermethylation during extended proliferation in vitro, in a pattern reminiscent of that reported in some primary tumours.

DNA methylation is essential for normal development and has been implicated in many pathologies including cancer. Our knowledge about the genome-wide distribution of DNA methylation, how it changes during cellular differentiation and how it relates to histone methylation and other chromatin modifications in mammals remains limited. Here we report the generation and analysis of genome-scale DNA methylation profiles at nucleotide resolution in mammalian cells. Using high-throughput reduced representation bisulphite sequencing and single-molecule-based sequencing, we generated DNA methylation maps covering most CpG islands, and a representative sampling of conserved non-coding elements, transposons and other genomic features, for mouse embryonic stem cells, embryonic-stem-cell-derived and primary neural cells, and eight other primary tissues. Several key findings emerge from the data. First, DNA methylation patterns are better correlated with histone methylation patterns than with the underlying genome sequence context. Second, methylation of CpGs are dynamic epigenetic marks that undergo extensive changes during cellular differentiation, particularly in regulatory regions outside of core promoters. Third, analysis of embryonic-stem-cell-derived and primary cells reveals that 'weak' CpG islands associated with a specific set of developmentally regulated genes undergo aberrant hypermethylation during extended proliferation in vitro, in a pattern reminiscent of that reported in some primary tumours.

DNA methylation is essential for normal development and has been implicated in many pathologies including cancer. Our knowledge about the genome-wide distribution of DNA methylation, how it changes during cellular differentiation and how it relates to histone methylation and other chromatin modifications in mammals remains limited. Here we report the generation and analysis of genome-scale DNA methylation profiles at nucleotide resolution in mammalian cells. Using high-throughput reduced representation bisulphite sequencing and single-molecule-based sequencing, we generated DNA methylation maps covering most CpG islands, and a representative sampling of conserved non-coding elements, transposons and other genomic features, for mouse embryonic stem cells, embryonic-stem-cell-derived and primary neural cells, and eight other primary tissues. Several key findings emerge from the data. First, DNA methylation patterns are better correlated with histone methylation patterns than with the underlying genome sequence context. Second, methylation of CpGs are dynamic epigenetic marks that undergo extensive changes during cellular differentiation, particularly in regulatory regions outside of core promoters. Third, analysis of embryonic-stem-cell-derived and primary cells reveals that 'weak' CpG islands associated with a specific set of developmentally regulated genes undergo aberrant hypermethylation during extended proliferation in vitro, in a pattern reminiscent of that reported in some primary tumours. More generally, the results establish reduced representation bisulphite sequencing as a powerful technology for epigenetic profiling of cell populations relevant to developmental biology, cancer and regenerative medicine.					23626	84779	56163	83481	55001	10880	168620	50511	133491	56165	84072	646457	84944	256933	132612	5161	4975	10290	8468	56903	10388	8718	54457	340602	64180	203447	64757	1674	10272	4438	10645	3755	83447	54514	6847	124535	150368
MILI_PSEUDOPODIA	M17507		18451862	Mili S,Moissoglu K,Macara IG		Table 1S			Mouse430_2	Jessica Robertson	Broad Institute	Transcripts significantly enriched in pseudopodia of NIH/3T3 cells (fibroblast) in response to both chemotactic (lysophosphatidic acid, LPA [PubChem=3988]) and haptotactic (fibronectin, FN1 [GeneID=2335) migratory stimuli.	RNA localization is important for the establishment and maintenance of polarity in multiple cell types. Localized RNAs are usually transported along microtubules or actin filaments and become anchored at their destination to some underlying subcellular structure. Retention commonly involves actin or actin-associated proteins, although cytokeratin filaments and dynein anchor certain RNAs. RNA localization is important for diverse processes ranging from cell fate determination to synaptic plasticity; however, so far there have been few comprehensive studies of localized RNAs in mammalian cells. Here we have addressed this issue, focusing on migrating fibroblasts that polarize to form a leading edge and a tail in a process that involves asymmetric distribution of RNAs. We used a fractionation scheme combined with microarrays to identify, on a genome-wide scale, RNAs that localize in protruding pseudopodia of mouse fibroblasts in response to migratory stimuli. We find that a diverse group of RNAs accumulates in such pseudopodial protrusions. Through their 3' untranslated regions these transcripts are anchored in granules concentrated at the plus ends of detyrosinated microtubules. RNAs in the granules associate with the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) tumour suppressor and the fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP). APC is required for the accumulation of transcripts in protrusions. Our results suggest a new type of RNA anchoring mechanism as well as a new, unanticipated function for APC in localizing RNAs.					127703	4921	648	54739	58476	900	23034	989	6451	23022	6990	894	1727	83939	324	5872	8500	359845	3646	25959	8816	3799	10749	8502	6845	8601	27336	221527	1736	26512	9846	80124	493753	83892	6741	3628	1059	80218	90102	5609	91057	29123	56947

Our results suggest a new type of RNA anchoring mechanism as well as a new, unanticipated function for APC in localizing RNAs.					5298	64834	54978	79073	51192	6646	10549	9653	64764	23613	6354	113419	2048	81928	4221	55240	23456	7922	1435	10985	23141	23087	9144	23765	22827	6513	2317	754	1186	949	10066	56926	58477	25800	285704	5589	3572	56172	92370	3678	26608	51144	10970	9088	535	80232	283131	23452	7204	79101	1497	10960	64747	686	79102	6721	871	6302	23516	5802	9013	51014	4053	29927	283431	203260	1798	1903	57493	25960	29123	3480	138050	9646	25926	84895	55798	254359	9777	9780	25921	27346	10423	84133	3489	8611	81610	10682	977	84912	4756	4891	90231	55129	29914	6553	6156	6615	23250	27433	121227	10558	7414	2734	55266	347734	283897	9811	25844	3783	55829	7320	55676	79962	54896	6836	8560	11068	118813	5727	51586	10954	84695	55089	2064	221035	9880	147015	3161	25930	3156	23246	54884	9562	8091	3949	23256	22845	4240	23197	9517	9725	79573	6548	23070	64215	10052	11037	6578	3710	6184	51478	54910	1284	9019	3835	4035	8692	9057	10399	3455	955	54929	7841	8614	6483	2030	7407	113189	2316	112	7329	10491	124565	5428	7049	7832	26090	22883	6382	161	9761	1471	6305	51246	7077	10195	147991	7133	9215	54965	22856	5394	5768	80146	154881	11018	84522	144110	23266	29967	254428	8985	25829	5097	79581	9854	9703	10078	8509	57526	7009	440400	9921	11070	112770	83742	53834	121665	92579	537	4247	9789	3998	81618	23211	6868	4781	337867	27020	3976	90203	79701	4684	23065	6678	9536	5819	10994	57142	23299	79065	283337	5118	202018	64645	8496	9962	23052	11188	5796	22853	55974	1889	10972	26020	1839	79188	10560	1522	2629	79796	8826	146059	2923	57488	5361	23344	83985	86	7162	23478	55069	682	5339	2717	6717	8884	780	26229	56851	8289	4849	91	2683	196527	2548	152002	81537	1278	9601	10313	60681	128869	7355	8140	84919	29965	1605	135228	6218	54407	23545	2260	91012	9334	6566	533	3675	55353	8651	6372	81490	51114	2668	64924	146433	51463	23140	221061	79157	8760	55332	23731	79644	6319	7094	4245	6136	340061	1211	143903	55683	9080	6649	80381	10067	81037	4054	7057	7056	255967	57210	57194	1282	57555	440026	6747	358	23659	1870	57222	488	4811	84925	4363	4791	947	8324	85441	56889	5792	5713	27097	55176	126792	199953	90933	6560	7105	131566	10280	114990	10598	284403	10548	10695	10127	1388	79956	51421	11079	64852	9451	80213	23654	83692	84892	2535	81539	10869	22984	148867	84696	57130	813	64129	9739	6574	116238	136	84888	5326	201562	3688	6609	57515	975	3309	22904	56928	6204	2817	1509	9902	55362	55298	1362	253558	25979	10134	10130	80210	55229	9697	94005	10458	1942	3566	2681	7106	79709	399909	150094	7701	151742	23463	124583	6651	79087	2132	9294	9654	23193	1947	6307	91252	2975	4926	6309	8473	4061	2286	3988	8744	11098	57217	649	3233	23108	219931	11128	517	10186	1843	6573	84975	79879	476	84641	27348	11014	9258	83877	55002	1603	6203	375033	60481	57661	11129	54732	4943	57181	8273	6713	10921	51172	26286	51430	55577	23450	25972	11161	5159	285761	7040	4052	154	60343	57153	10743	10781	84876	441631	9526	29956	8165	29954	11270	79070	54814	55161	1861	1514	81031	166647	51495	84720	415116	55512	83879	64718	84447	91289	2799	10057	54918	991	84629	334	4074	29095	3703	387263	7538	81559	9993	375056	79586	9375	51009	51343	51303	83481	57636	10613	51061	57136	54434	4097	128486	10867	166929	4313	2896	1837	3340	55253	79770	2531	6347	55852	27242	79143	85450	259230	10232	7873	7837	55030	928	23174	23327	54602	8974	374354	9497	93185	27090	10221	6433	10539	2697	27143	388796	2707	113235	55054	9757	1185	8507	9354	10479	51528	3619	3213	10999	9825	7779	84336	3912	10026	2318	9052	26233	961	9782	153527	1287	5663	2050	7298	55322	8804	1147	80209	54478	23529	206358	5033	51704	3064	103	10227	51239	25907	81619	5742	29015	23759	3339	5347	90196	904	1650	8828	5442	558	220323	6575	6720	5447	54902	2990	56160	80263	8879	57205	201232	23275	7059	23151	11331	54756	51643	56005	63027	51330	9069	79711	10488	114823	728661	91663	84271	5977	6229

We have used high-density DNA microarrays to provide an analysis of gene regulation during the mammalian cell cycle and the role of E2F in this process. Cell cycle analysis was facilitated by a combined examination of gene control in serum-stimulated fibroblasts and cells synchronized at G(1)/S by hydroxyurea block that were then released to proceed through the cell cycle. The latter approach (G(1)/S synchronization) is critical for rigorously maintaining cell synchrony for unambiguous analysis of gene regulation in later stages of the cell cycle. Analysis of these samples identified seven distinct clusters of genes that exhibit unique patterns of expression. Genes tend to cluster within these groups based on common function and the time during the cell cycle that the activity is required. Placed in this context, the analysis of genes induced by E2F proteins identified genes or expressed sequence tags not previously described as regulated by E2F proteins; surprisingly, many of these encode proteins known to function during mitosis. A comparison of the E2F-induced genes with the patterns of cell growth-regulated gene expression revealed that virtually all of the E2F-induced genes are found in only two of the cell cycle clusters; one group was regulated at G(1)/S, and the second group, which included the mitotic activities, was regulated at G(2). The activation of the G(2) genes suggests a broader role for E2F in the control of both DNA replication and mitotic activities.					83879	5925	7153	891	7083	6241	1031	3149	898	3925	3838	1017	151648	5557	10403	9212	55723	5983	699	890	2146	3930	6117	54443	983	23397	9133	10592	1854	51203	7884	81620	79733	29089	79077	10926	3978	991	244	4176	5111	2237	9055	9319	6240	4288	9232	1763	7298	4172	27065	3148	5888

Identifying variations in DNA that increase susceptibility to disease is one of the primary aims of genetic studies using a forward genetics approach. However, identification of disease-susceptibility genes by means of such studies provides limited functional information on how genes lead to disease. In fact, in most cases there is an absence of functional information altogether, preventing a definitive identification of the susceptibility gene or genes. Here we develop an alternative to the classic forward genetics approach for dissecting complex disease traits where, instead of identifying susceptibility genes directly affected by variations in DNA, we identify gene networks that are perturbed by susceptibility loci and that in turn lead to disease. Application of this method to liver and adipose gene expression data generated from a segregating mouse population results in the identification of a macrophage-enriched network supported as having a causal relationship with disease traits associated with metabolic syndrome. Three genes in this network, lipoprotein lipase (Lpl), lactamase beta (Lactb) and protein phosphatase 1-like (Ppm1l), are validated as previously unknown obesity genes, strengthening the association between this network and metabolic disease traits. Our analysis provides direct experimental support that complex traits such as obesity are emergent properties of molecular networks that are modulated by complex genetic loci and environmental factors.					4921	3898	9910	6675	51744	11266	50717	130355	54935	25992	55502	2213	11132	2326	10380	2329	8497	7391	23556	25778	79762	63931	80255	51478	148713	116461	10216	22930	91687	64388	10625	7100	257177	388722	9859	10096	50848	5498	9507	6646	55157	8564	51377	2207	9525	89796	29937	51141	64757	189	51540	79083	8490	55699	26750	26092	126823	84083	29922	56950	325	1314	7779	51706	128387	93185	51022	64284	1622	55600	79919	654790	28513	56776	92703	4817	336	8703	8685	140738	9917	5362	64407	962	3078	6708	3428	54953	114836	93183	9208	6391	6000

DNA methylation is essential for normal development and has been implicated in many pathologies including cancer. Our knowledge about the genome-wide distribution of DNA methylation, how it changes during cellular differentiation and how it relates to histone methylation and other chromatin modifications in mammals remains limited. Here we report the generation and analysis of genome-scale DNA methylation profiles at nucleotide resolution in mammalian cells. Using high-throughput reduced representation bisulphite sequencing and single-molecule-based sequencing, we generated DNA methylation maps covering most CpG islands, and a representative sampling of conserved non-coding elements, transposons and other genomic features, for mouse embryonic stem cells, embryonic-stem-cell-derived and primary neural cells, and eight other primary tissues. Several key findings emerge from the data. First, DNA methylation patterns are better correlated with histone methylation patterns than with the underlying genome sequence context.

The BMI-1 oncogene-driven gene expression pathway is essential for the self-renewal of hematopoietic and neural stem cells. We applied a mouse/human comparative translational genomics approach to identify an 11-gene signature that consistently displays a stem cell-resembling expression profile in distant metastatic lesions as revealed by the analysis of metastases and primary tumors from a transgenic mouse model of prostate cancer and cancer patients. To further validate these results, we examined the prognostic power of the 11-gene signature in several independent therapy-outcome sets of clinical samples obtained from 1,153 cancer patients diagnosed with 11 different types of cancer, including 5 epithelial malignancies (prostate, breast, lung, ovarian, and bladder cancers) and 5 nonepithelial malignancies (lymphoma, mesothelioma, medulloblastoma, glioma, and acute myeloid leukemia). Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated that a stem cell-like expression profile of the 11-gene signature in primary tumors is a consistent powerful predictor of a short interval to disease recurrence, distant metastasis, and death after therapy in cancer patients diagnosed with 11 distinct types of cancer. These data suggest the presence of a conserved BMI-1-driven pathway, which is similarly engaged in both normal stem cells and a highly malignant subset of human cancers diagnosed in a wide range of organs and uniformly exhibiting a marked propensity toward metastatic dissemination as well as a high probability of unfavorable therapy outcome.					3054	6045	23326	2637	4288	699	891

Foxp3+CD4+CD25+ regulatory T (T(reg)) cells are essential for the prevention of autoimmunity. T(reg) cells have an attenuated cytokine response to T-cell receptor stimulation, and can suppress the proliferation and effector function of neighbouring T cells. The forkhead transcription factor Foxp3 (forkhead box P3) is selectively expressed in T(reg) cells, is required for T(reg) development and function, and is sufficient to induce a T(reg) phenotype in conventional CD4+CD25- T cells. Mutations in Foxp3 cause severe, multi-organ autoimmunity in both human and mouse. FOXP3 can cooperate in a DNA-binding complex with NFAT (nuclear factor of activated T cells) to regulate the transcription of several known target genes. However, the global set of genes regulated directly by Foxp3 is not known and consequently, how this transcription factor controls the gene expression programme for T(reg) function is not understood. Here we identify Foxp3 target genes and report that many of these are key modulators of T-cell activation and function.

Foxp3+CD4+CD25+ regulatory T (T(reg)) cells are essential for the prevention of autoimmunity. T(reg) cells have an attenuated cytokine response to T-cell receptor stimulation, and can suppress the proliferation and effector function of neighbouring T cells. The forkhead transcription factor Foxp3 (forkhead box P3) is selectively expressed in T(reg) cells, is required for T(reg) development and function, and is sufficient to induce a T(reg) phenotype in conventional CD4+CD25- T cells. Mutations in Foxp3 cause severe, multi-organ autoimmunity in both human and mouse. FOXP3 can cooperate in a DNA-binding complex with NFAT (nuclear factor of activated T cells) to regulate the transcription of several known target genes. However, the global set of genes regulated directly by Foxp3 is not known and consequently, how this transcription factor controls the gene expression programme for T(reg) function is not understood. Here we identify Foxp3 target genes and report that many of these are key modulators of T-cell activation and function. Remarkably, the predominant, although not exclusive, effect of Foxp3 occupancy is to suppress the activation of target genes on T-cell stimulation. Foxp3 suppression of its targets appears to be crucial for the normal function of T(reg) cells, because overactive variants of some target genes are known to be associated with autoimmune disease.					7351	8600	57679	4794	9689	83641	27086	151888	5140	10892	6047	26191	387357	4609	3717	84807	79961	64859	9221	10228	7050	5450	4155	2953	9452	1848	2030	3702	4074	3458	1652	678	10268	51082	10171	2643	8507	57476	3558	7535	27042	25897	133418	2107	29909	4616	79697	100506736	5997	694	4772	8644	55573	81620

NAKAYAMA_FGF2_TARGETS	M1984		17284717	Nakayama T,Mutsuga N,Tosato G		Table 1, 1S			UnigeneIdentifiers	Jessica Robertson	Broad Institute	Genes down-regulated in S-17 cells (bone marrow stroma) after stimulation with FGF2 [GeneID=2247].	BACKGROUND: Reduction of intramedullary hematopoiesis and the development of myelofibrosis and splenic hematopoiesis are frequent complications of clonal myeloid disorders that cause severe morbidity and death and present a therapeutic challenge. However, the pathogenesis of these complications is still unknown. We evaluated the effect of fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF-2), the level of which is elevated in patients with clonal myeloid disorders, on bone marrow stromal cell expression of stromal cell-derived factor 1 (SDF-1), a chemokine that is essential for normal hematopoiesis. METHODS: Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis, immunoblot analysis, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays were used to examine effects of human recombinant FGF-2 exposure on SDF-1 expression in mouse stromal MS-5 and S-17 cells. Cocultures of human CD34-positive peripheral blood stem cells or mouse pre-B DW34 cells with mouse stromal cells were used to characterize the functional relevance of the effects of FGF-2 on SDF-1 expression. The in vivo hematologic effects of FGF-2 were determined by systemic administration to mice (n = 10). All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: FGF-2 reduced constitutive SDF-1 mRNA expression and secretion in stromal cells (SDF-1 levels in supernatants: MS-5 cells cultured for 3 days in medium only versus in medium with FGF-2, 95.4 ng/mL versus 22.2 ng/mL, difference = 73.2 ng/mL, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 60.52 to 85.87 ng/mL; P = .002, two-sided Student's t test; S-17 cultured in medium only versus in medium with FGF-2, 203.53 ng/mL versus 32.36 ng/mL, difference = 171.17 ng/mL, 95% CI = 161.8 to 180.6 ng/mL; P<.001). These effects of FGF-2 were reversible. FGF-2 compromised stromal cell support of the growth and survival of pre-B DW34 and myeloid lineage cells, and these effects were reversed in part by exogenous recombinant SDF-1alpha (rSDF-1alpha) (DW34 pre-B cells recovery on S-17 stromal cells, expressed as a percentage of DW34 cells recovered from medium only: with FGF-2 versus without FGF-2, 27.6% versus 100%, difference = 72.4%, 95% CI = 45.34% to 99.51%, P = .008; with FGF-2 plus rSDF1 versus with FGF-2 only, 60.3% versus 27.6%, difference = 32.7%, 95% CI = 9.35% to 56.08%, P = .034; fold increase in number of myeloid lineage cells after culture on S-17 stromal cells: with FGF-2 versus without FGF-2, 0.25-fold versus 3.8-fold, difference = 3.55-fold, 95% CI = 2.66- to 4.44-fold, P<.001; recovery of myeloid cells on S-17 stromal cells, expressed as a percentage of myeloid cells recovered from medium only: FGF-2 plus rSDF-1alpha versus FGF-2 only, 76.5% versus 32.4%, difference = 44.1%, 95% CI = 32.58% to 55.68%, P<.001). Administration of FGF-2 to mice reversibly reduced bone marrow levels of SDF-1 and cellularity and induced immature myeloid cell mobilization, extramedullary hematopoiesis, and splenomegaly. CONCLUSIONS: Systemic administration of FGF-2 in mice disrupts normal bone marrow hematopoiesis in part through reduced expression of SDF-1. Thus, endogenous FGF-2 may represent a potential therapeutic target in clonal myeloid disorders characterized by bone marrow failure.					196410	3479	55737	6307	23217	5159	59	7862	59272	6633	8458	1280	56944	284366	9547	652968	4637	26585	1290	6387	1277	81502	1295	1282	3454	54344	2875	122945	54622

Chr3 (DB), B.D. Chr3 (BD) and the parental strains B6 and D2.	We mapped quantitative trait loci that accounted for the variation in hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) numbers between young adult C57BL/6 (B6) and DBA/2 (D2) mice. In reciprocal chromosome 3 congenic mice, introgressed D2 alleles increased HSC numbers owing to enhanced proliferation and self-renewal and reduced apoptosis, whereas B6 alleles had the opposite effects. Using oligonucleotide arrays, real-time PCR and protein blots, we identified latexin (Lxn), a gene whose differential transcription and expression was associated with the allelic differences. Expression was inversely correlated with the number of HSCs; therefore, ectopic expression of Lxn using a retroviral vector decreased stem cell population size. We identified clusters of SNPs upstream of the Lxn transcriptional start site, at least two of which are associated with potential binding sites for transcription factors regulating stem cells. Thus, promoter polymorphisms between the B6 and D2 alleles may affect Lxn gene expression and consequently influence the population size of hematopoietic stem cells.					10514	148534	334	6277	9232	8328	7846	2205	3992	10235	84902	4884	79086	2971	5599	6282	56925

Neu transgenic (FVBN202) mice develop spontaneous tumors and cannot reject it (tumor tolerance model). To dissect the mechanisms associated with rejection or tolerance of MMC tumors, we compared transcriptional patterns within the tumor microenvironment of MMC undergoing rejection with those that resisted it either because of tumor evasion/antigen loss recurrence (ANV tumors) or because of intrinsic tolerance mechanisms displayed by the transgenic mice. Gene profiling confirmed that immune rejection is primarily mediated through activation of IFN-stimulated genes and T-cell effector mechanisms. The tumor evasion model showed combined activation of Th1 and Th2 with a deviation toward Th2 and humoral immune responses that failed to achieve rejection likely because of lack of target antigen. Interestingly, the tumor tolerance model instead displayed immune suppression pathways through activation of regulatory mechanisms that included in particular the overexpression of interleukin-10 (IL-10), IL-10 receptor, and suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS)-1 and SOCS-3.

Gene expression profiling was used to identify differences in gene expression between tumor cells and normal plasma cells (NPC) and to cluster the tumors into two groups (tumor groups C and D), with distinct gene expression profiles. Four hundred and ninety-five genes were significantly different between both tumor groups and NPCs, whereas 124 genes were uniquely different from NPCs in tumor group C and 204 genes were uniquely different from NPCs in tumor group D.

We mapped quantitative trait loci (QTLs) associated with variation in expression of thousands of transcripts.

Self-renewal is a hallmark of stem cells and cancer, but existence of a shared stemness program remains controversial. Here, we construct a gene module map to systematically relate transcriptional programs in embryonic stem cells (ESCs), adult tissue stem cells, and human cancers. This map reveals two predominant gene modules that distinguish ESCs and adult tissue stem cells. The ESC-like transcriptional program is activated in diverse human epithelial cancers and strongly predicts metastasis and death. c-Myc, but not other oncogenes, is sufficient to reactivate the ESC-like program in normal and cancer cells. In primary human keratinocytes transformed by Ras and I kappa B alpha, c-Myc increases the fraction of tumor-initiating cells by 150-fold, enabling tumor formation and serial propagation with as few as 500 cells. c-Myc-enhanced tumor initiation is cell-autonomous and independent of genomic instability. Thus, activation of an ESC-like transcriptional program in differentiated adult cells may induce pathologic self-renewal characteristic of cancer stem cells.					1490	65108	1282	3164	1741	5090	124540	230	4254	10211	219347	2022	23433	26137	9455	23467	57180	1284	25932	84935	10771	9823	400961	91107	55647	285440	3737	26002	6546	8611	114770	4781	8722	2909	2556	28232	4297	715	3664	653140	8538	65981	4053	170954	54463	64332	8508	4824	23066	121599	8639	2669	27086	9208	162655	288	79603	115	2317	6505	4887	7262	55805	10656	64123	6262	3751	388581	2798	54566	23175	1312	11098	1649	3482	7358	1026	54542	4050	4046	10268	2050	3956	2793	4345	7225	10912	6886	1844	26246	29094	9743	3131	53635	10404	3716	4430	4792	10769	1791	7450	3306	85358	154	10140	3108	51744	80781	1154	23566	3554	84302	57326	373156	79071	7421	5649	84260	571	28959	159296	55117	1277	317705	50861	55365	8822	2335	2941	7436	857	7016	100506742	4739	283383	1272	54477	7130	22795	26524	57683	9021	5999	5971	9315	161882	81572	1000	6775	871	10957	1291	5837	51100	5025	1437	10561	8633	4300	7010	10681	64407	2569	64135	9531	51232	22954	10219	5087	26471	1149	9002	4897	403	3665	3303	10427	388	7295	10247	10544	6091	6520	8460	7078	939	9537	162239	146198	4585	816	6863	1396	7021	6653	3682	6387	7474	51655	4092	4286	130814	4326	5997	23387	4363	3169	2633	55364	5734	6382	1757	26353	845	203	6236	26585	5569	6558	1266	7052	4189	5054	6860	89796	8987	3778	9639	4038	947	114876	3491	2152	5873	3486	8870	8456	8495	64114	7158	1438	56624	10395	4653	64094	958	25925	8436	10231	79885	4692	9452	55870	3776	2246	8613	9429	4638	3383	7984	3202	2882	10979	10370	460	4147	3300	3200	5947	7168	1948	1051	10418	4665	1028	353116	94234	627	5654	122704	11015	1850	4929	23710	2045	3490	58480	5358	4684	26054	6533	7164	10148	2892	2535	54165	395	1179	221035	3606	122786	6899	506	54206	26056	2342	7057	4026	5978	9500	6352	2149	9934	9547	81618	29887	4478	4352	976	9437	8876	7571	4052	133	4257	55607	55859	3736	2920	10365	84276	6422	9314	3559	3400	667	3912	28970	56172	3199	6324	23645	8835	5284	11202	55500	11167	3459	116068	138151	29114	84662	26064	2891	51617	60481	1951	1608	8809	57544	55911	1380	11107	9636	351	10950	654790	359845	56121	26960	23218	5743	1911	4982	3304	23569	8549	10536	5588	3853	8001	87	51669	1140	55901	7075	83850	3488	7106	4621	92675	2935	4205	393	6237	57451	8490	5217	4054	83871	2534	5741	10095	23635	5579	2199	3726	4211	6403	2012	27122	23331	2565	11123	3397	55861	1545	5567	2015	11328	3206	3398	8553	3172	9420	339665	7071	55553	60436	874	23164	7412	9859	56667	5151	9592	9019	5362	11030	55672	55740	2628	27130	9204	2550	633	79575	5581	8910	2643	254428	9510	8777	22982	55714	54765	10363	3600	1522	3569	23705	9254	6356	6275	3895	1052	3221	22858	3371	186	7837	255231	2776	1316	7832	5813	3458	22998	6925	6319	8800	6793	51186	10207	5376	6595	149986	11346	6348	3358	6284	57447	23328	152189	863	953	3142	10609	6678	8535	56262	390816	23499	3553	9202	10209	57537	84626	64129	23368	5187	81621	6769	2353	112464	2296	10838	4811	687	29950	133308	4675	3693	285313	317671	6271	2114	1265	2697	27445	64116	3725	2044	1601	2322	153090	10633	94121	55930	19	6453	6447	4242	84858	23464	23410	51	7586	800	80318	2059	781	4086	57761	22835	2516	8204	23682	64400	51466	6238	8848	6812	80760	160622	10186	6277	5764	4121	7185	6354	1195	11099	7274	7105	6497	10850	6659	9053	85440	4784	55904	118429	9619	2624	202	9135	1301	133418	7267	90952	64236	567	57157	10743	1606	2354	5178	51661	23239	7325	6876	64799	9215	27244	8477	84898	10631	219409	9863	10409	1992	4613	153222	1789	29969	1839	5782	27295	5341	4082	5106	56937	57152	90102	7060	148479	338442	4240	3625	837	79101	54541	1628	467	5138	27125	27071	2894	5288	9289	7025	27285	4005	9262	79819	140735	488	1843	7525	9099	824	11080	2273	5176	2897	4065	57491	22936	26136	5480	91663	112	3248	214	272	10398	10716	3897	3171	754	51523	25	7084	3588	23604	3959	26022	166647	349149	26298	1805	348	203447	1959	5154	3815	2049	56271	1299	3205	84617	2752	29993	64581	3915	9723	55337	4685	3434	3727	3908	5311	595	7940	5733	10787	4133	5796	22822	2625	164091	10410	1756	401548	51704	7088	5790	1846	104	2139

We report the application of single-molecule-based sequencing technology for high-throughput profiling of histone modifications in mammalian cells. By obtaining over four billion bases of sequence from chromatin immunoprecipitated DNA, we generated genome-wide chromatin-state maps of mouse embryonic stem cells, neural progenitor cells and embryonic fibroblasts. We find that lysine 4 and lysine 27 trimethylation effectively discriminates genes that are expressed, poised for expression, or stably repressed, and therefore reflect cell state and lineage potential. Lysine 36 trimethylation marks primary coding and non-coding transcripts, facilitating gene annotation. Trimethylation of lysine 9 and lysine 20 is detected at satellite, telomeric and active long-terminal repeats, and can spread into proximal unique sequences. Lysine 4 and lysine 9 trimethylation marks imprinting control regions. Finally, we show that chromatin state can be read in an allele-specific manner by using single nucleotide polymorphisms.

This study provides a framework for the application of comprehensive chromatin profiling towards characterization of diverse mammalian cell populations.					83692	345611	23475	4485	288	80323	353088	55906	11187	10410	51733	669	22868	7059	80304	29115	2709	7098	150159	8536	55756	374739	28978	26121	55035	343521	200879	5440	166824	285025	79140	55771	916	534	89953	339829	284406	339906	5557	51561	64081	347475	284307	6696	23650	287	3908	55505	390760	3108	54941	389874	84676	54933	57333	4778	3340	2707	119710	55238	4035	10903	7010	5224	80034	161823	1121	84258	5547	10351	8450	9527	60343	10013	80308	57804	78997	6143	10758	8438	137872	135932	245812	9256	59344	5024	54838	130752	51166	2941	79924	23301	55262	55997	51070	222643	8115	8187	115795	2307	63910	10256	599	57106	27071	5169	3600	56895	3973	54453	3623	84807	5327	54546	60412	9726	23613	63901	57407	164395	6451	6335	54768	2968	60681	93233	6559	85014	142685	729515	391002	125875	2920	148170	7802	55759	558	58530	23643	9747	80736	26064	83690	127534	6764	64122	64129	50619	23583	79661	84219	89944	84671	7097	1728	64421	51700	84318	167681	3988	85329	84134	79833	54331	388695	25914	79628	133308	57480	5652	401409	5540	3695	57326	1192	167838	55294	147710	6013	340152	50509	9310	23213	91966	642843	57707	10363	54970	9507	128218	55781	230	9465	1200	51088	5460	55033	29090	389421	8820	51276	9399	25870	56180	55204	1497	80017	79096	6450	8578	64780	391013	139322	112483	131831	10161	6134	126393	26873	6997	146845	79025	151516	55610	2696	8382	1143	84276	23550	57659	4504	79867	51393	51703	54854	6775	85300	1774	7851	2115	84814	23503	6911	55731	5274	3739	79675	4606	253039	5051	4993	23321	2793	8001	23569	319	29844	160140	2877	1146	919	10107	54964	55012	81031	84466	145864	29922	375316	221091	3433	83592	148811	6861	51398	56892	158234	114897	9338	9452	51249	2542	28985	125113	51530	84647	285676	6781	57538	199704	10157	51170	80128	112802	9729	3913	55633	54827	316	952	5993	4357	25975	54520	151651	2825	197135	90592	6271	368	57282	64172	93663	5027	8789	3476	26094	8399	9170	387032	79814	65987	113622	5087	823	145748	10226	254013	10150	219931	8082	22899	286046	1519	10195	116159	7035	6284	256691	157574	132625	55341	9472	79083	54994	23769	7288	100505576	147686	389075	151871	1911	29952	55893	51313	11092	5261	80298	10406	79020	5790	5936	338773	140807	582	125965	55815	142679	2944	2886	196074	157773	5122	256380	155051	4033	8224	159090	1287	5446	5890	147798	89876	23348	26063	9901	219681	10741	2012	800	1013	9582	83473	10626	154150	84889	23779	1607	126129	126820	79442	360163	51673	578	375444	57449	516	201799	6865	1277	163590	80006	84891	8544	130132	9990	283337	761	10371	391059	51286	51318	146861	339123	7771	64927	10144	9317	1375	345462	3872	493869	55285	10581	6494	390999	55584	3077	254863	6678	57693	6887	51024	8749	978	50485	163259	161247	2952	9046	139341	91801	23660	10840	94121	79669	9961	25876	2791	135935	53347	6990	143884	222658	79960	55586	4674	9768	55601	768	123904	83729	5939	5872	11189	6948	84304	51474	83450	1184	219539	50486	79567	23017	2896	55954	114881	710	148103	9400	83480	2523	6261	65991	90353	84795	7185	414328	203	4524	117854	7784	374920	54841	3626	10241	9468	85478	283248	25854	5058	9518	29108	202915	1891	284427	57159	7379	2901	29926	81607	222183	51447	51661	6927	56521	2892	7076	9696	286144	5831	400891	1742	3977	8711	115201	9900	359787	1999	257106	116534	9913	4935	23767	112817	2639	727800	79602	25974	1294	90529	283777	728927	55211	22906	27124	7069	2582	8928	56924	8989	1565	339324	342897	225	3750	286187	9937	84836	1962	10886	23135	89	956	89927	95	3373	79767	51520	2596	6102	3161	9862	3305	1500	5092	27040	91147	401551	388595	64431	9755	10712	57016	80760	5527	26007	80023	6857	4257	2948	151827	26353	123	25961	399473	120	2919	169166	349633	83657	26278	6556	8200	8548	145226	10404	84514	7916	6323	114902	90843	254228	2494	283897	51019	2268	441161	147929	221078	4242	9844	27072	306	8698	80309	780776	786	494143	56204	11011	25802	844	3010	81855	5002	130589	115727	197257	113277	24140	23229	285513	92822	5054	84083	116362	9080	51063	55	79005	23562	57224	138162	4351	7130	5371	8993	57102	158521	7755	9573	146754	51626	147700	493861	401546	79755	79989	64852	201456	9536	51109	7569	51225	53354	388789	25862	57153	643866	90864	10389	90288	9378	9610	145407	27134	2	91894	8871	4988	23067	80761	57156	3265	79136	268	222255	79746	84446	344148	3338	23526	953	1240	55076	7041	140460

We report the application of single-molecule-based sequencing technology for high-throughput profiling of histone modifications in mammalian cells. By obtaining over four billion bases of sequence from chromatin immunoprecipitated DNA, we generated genome-wide chromatin-state maps of mouse embryonic stem cells, neural progenitor cells and embryonic fibroblasts. We find that lysine 4 and lysine 27 trimethylation effectively discriminates genes that are expressed, poised for expression, or stably repressed, and therefore reflect cell state and lineage potential. Lysine 36 trimethylation marks primary coding and non-coding transcripts, facilitating gene annotation. Trimethylation of lysine 9 and lysine 20 is detected at satellite, telomeric and active long-terminal repeats, and can spread into proximal unique sequences.

An enriched environment is known to promote structural changes in the brain and to enhance learning and memory performance in rodents [Hebb, D. O. (1947) Am. Psychol. 2, 306-307]. To better understand the molecular mechanisms underlying these experience-dependent cognitive changes, we have used high-density oligonucleotide microarrays to analyze gene expression in the brain. Expression of a large number of genes changes in response to enrichment training, many of which can be linked to neuronal structure, synaptic plasticity, and transmission. A number of these genes may play important roles in modulating learning and memory capacity.					6711	6256	581	11113	4504	10049	4900	5048	5550	839

Expression of proteasomal subunits genes (LMP2, LMP7 and PSMB5) involved in the MHC class I presentation pathway were modulated indicating the formation of immunoproteasomes improving antigen presentation. Expression of one subunit of a transporter (TAP1) responsible for importing degraded antigens into ER was increased, similarly to the BAG2 gene that modulates chaperone activity in ER helping proper loading on MHC class I molecules.

The molecular mechanism responsible for a decline of stem cell functioning after replicative stress remains unknown. We used mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) to identify genes involved in the process of cellular aging. In proliferating and senescent MEFs one of the most differentially expressed transcripts was Enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (Ezh2), a Polycomb group protein (PcG) involved in histone methylation and deacetylation. Retroviral overexpression of Ezh2 in MEFs resulted in bypassing of the senescence program. More importantly, whereas normal HSCs were rapidly exhausted after serial transplantations, overexpression of Ezh2 completely conserved long-term repopulating potential. Animals that were reconstituted with 3 times serially transplanted control bone marrow cells all died due to hematopoietic failure. In contrast, similarly transplanted Ezh2-overexpressing stem cells restored stem cell quality to normal levels. In a genetic genomics screen, we identified novel putative Ezh2 target or partner stem cell genes that are associated with chromatin modification. Our data suggest that stabilization of the chromatin structure preserves HSC potential after replicative stress.					8942	3150	207063	79707	2709	2272	653319	5662	221955	7469	2775	4302	10567	4288	6920	375616	1369	144100	55530	55749	3397	81890	64857	100506562	6821	1994	2146	79575	79822	132660	7060	57617	1196	84920	3837	8289	55160	2960	552889	2922	79039

PPAR gamma is an adipocyte-specific nuclear hormone receptor. Agonists of PPAR gamma, such as thiazolidinediones (TZDs), promote adipocyte differentiation and have insulin-sensitizing effects in animals and diabetic patients. Affymetrix oligonucleotide arrays representing 6347 genes were employed to profile the gene expression responses of mature 3T3-L1 adipocytes and differentiating preadipocytes to a TZD PPAR gamma agonist in vitro. The expression of 579 genes was significantly up- or down-regulated by more than 1.5-fold during differentiation and/or by treatment with TZD, and these genes were organized into 32 clusters that demonstrated concerted changes in expression of genes controlling cell growth or lipid metabolism. Quantitative PCR was employed to further characterize gene expression and led to the identification of beta-catenin as a new PPAR gamma target gene. Both mRNA and protein levels for beta-catenin were down-regulated in 3T3-L1 adipocytes compared with fibroblasts and were further decreased by treatment of adipocytes with PPAR gamma agonists. Treatment of db/db mice with a PPAR gamma agonist also resulted in reduction of beta-catenin mRNA levels in adipose tissue. These results suggest that beta-catenin plays an important role in the regulation of adipogenesis.

ONGUSAHA_BRCA1_TARGETS_UP	M2067		12802282	Ongusaha PP,Ouchi T,Kim KT,Nytko E,Kwak JC,Duda RB,Deng CX,Lee SW		Table 2: Upregulated genes			SEQ_ACCESSION	Arthur Liberzon	Broad Institute	Genes up-regulated in MEF cells (embryonic fibroblast) lacking TP53 and BRCA1 [GeneID=7157;672] by expression of BRCA1.	The tumor suppressor protein BRCA1 has been shown to enhance p53 transcription, whereas activated p53 represses BRCA1 transcription. To further understand the functional interaction of these proteins, we investigated the role of BRCA1 in p53-induced phenotypes. We found that BRCA1 when subjected to forced expression acts synergistically with wild-type p53, resulting in irreversible growth arrest, as shown by VhD mouse fibroblast cells expressing a temperature-sensitive mutant of p53. Furthermore, reintroduction of both BRCA1 and p53 into BRCA1(-/-)/p53(-/-) mouse embryonic fibroblasts markedly increased the senescence phenotype compared to that induced by p53 alone. In particular, we found that BRCA1 expression attenuated p53-mediated cell death in response to gamma-irradiation. Moreover, microarray screening of 11 000 murine genes demonstrated that a set of genes upregulated by p53 is enhanced by coexpression of BRCA1 and p53, suggesting that BRCA1 and p53 exert a promoter selectivity leading to a specific phenotype. Taken together, our results provide evidence that BRCA1 is involved in p53-mediated growth suppression rather than apoptosis.					3162	4322	1647	3006	1893	5168	80781	7045	28986	3860	5950	348	54541

The tumor suppressor protein BRCA1 has been shown to enhance p53 transcription, whereas activated p53 represses BRCA1 transcription. To further understand the functional interaction of these proteins, we investigated the role of BRCA1 in p53-induced phenotypes. We found that BRCA1 when subjected to forced expression acts synergistically with wild-type p53, resulting in irreversible growth arrest, as shown by VhD mouse fibroblast cells expressing a temperature-sensitive mutant of p53. Furthermore, reintroduction of both BRCA1 and p53 into BRCA1(-/-)/p53(-/-) mouse embryonic fibroblasts markedly increased the senescence phenotype compared to that induced by p53 alone. In particular, we found that BRCA1 expression attenuated p53-mediated cell death in response to gamma-irradiation. Moreover, microarray screening of 11 000 murine genes demonstrated that a set of genes upregulated by p53 is enhanced by coexpression of BRCA1 and p53, suggesting that BRCA1 and p53 exert a promoter selectivity leading to a specific phenotype.

Transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta) regulates cellular functions like proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. On the cell surface, TGF-beta binds to receptor complexes consisting of TGF-beta receptor type II (TbetaRII) and activin-like kinase receptor-5 (Alk5), and the downstream signaling is transduced by Smad and MAPK proteins. Recent data have shown that alternative receptor combinations aside from the classical pairing of TbetaRII/Alk5 can be relevant for TGF-beta signaling. We have screened for alternative receptors for TGF-beta and also for gene targets of TGF-beta signaling, by performing functional assays and microarray analysis in murine embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cell lines lacking Alk5. Data from TGF-beta-stimulated Alk5(-/-) cells show them to be completely unaffected by TGF-beta. Additionally, 465 downstream targets of Alk5 signaling were identified when comparing Alk5(-/-) or TGF-beta-stimulated Alk5(+/+) MEFs with unstimulated Alk5(+/+) cells.

Neuroendocrine (NE) phenotype, seen in >30% of prostate adenocarcinomas (PCa), and NE prostate tumors are implicated in aggressive prostate cancer. Formation of NE prostate tumors in the TRAMP mouse model was suppressed in mice lacking the ubiquitin ligase Siah2, which regulates HIF-1alpha availability.

Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) activity is regulated through association with ligands that include the thiazolidinedione class of antidiabetic drugs, as well as derivatives of polyunsaturated fatty acids. Induction of PPARgamma target gene expression involves ligand-dependent reconfiguration of the ligand-binding domain (LBD), followed by recruitment of specific transcriptional coactivators. In this study, we have identified an amino acid (F372) within helix 7 of the LBD that is required for the response of PPARgamma to endogenous ligands. Additionally, the data show that this amino acid is also required for expression of a novel subset of adipocyte genes (group 2), including fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21), and that the FGF21 gene is a direct target of PPARgamma. Expression of the group 2 genes is selectively repressed by the NAD-dependent deacetylase SIRT1 in mature 3T3-L1 adipocytes, since knockdown of SIRT1 through the constitutive expression of a corresponding RNA interference enhances their expression without affecting the expression of classic adipogenic genes, such as adiponectin and FABP4/aP2. It appears that many of the group 2 genes repressed by SIRT1 in mature adipocytes correspond to the same set of genes that are selectively activated by treatment of fat cells with the PPARgamma ligand, troglitazone.

CUL7 binds to SKP1, RBX1, and FBXW8 to form a cullin-RING ligase, or an SKP1-cullin-F box protein complex. The targeted disruption of the Cul7 gene in mice results in significant reduction in embryo size and neonatal lethality. In humans, CUL7 was found to be mutated in the 3-M dwarfism syndrome characterized by severe pre- and postnatal growth retardation, indicating that CUL7 is closely associated with human and mouse growth. We generated mice lacking Fbxw8 by gene trapping. Similar to Cul7(-/-) animals, Fbxw8(-/-) embryos and placentas were smaller than wild-type and heterozygous littermates and placentas. Approximately 30% of the expected number of Fbxw8(-/-) mice survived birth, but these mice remained smaller than their wild-type and heterozygous littermates throughout postnatal development. FBXW8 expression was detected in most organs of wild-type mice examined, and the organs in Fbxw8(-/-) mice were smaller than those in wild-type mice. Fbxw8 expression levels were highest in skeletal muscle, cartilage, and lung tissue. Expression profiling revealed elevated levels of insulin-like growth factor binding protein 1 (IGFBP1) transcripts in Fbxw8(-/-) embryos. Furthermore, we observed increased levels of IGFBP2 in Cul7(-/-) as well as Fbxw8(-/-) fibroblasts. These results demonstrate that the FBXW8-CUL7 complex plays a significant role in growth control.					89	6433	487	84333	4606	26259	3484	84665	6261

Whereas DNA methylation is essential for genomic imprinting, the importance of histone methylation in the allelic expression of imprinted genes is unclear. Imprinting control regions (ICRs), however, are marked by histone H3-K9 methylation on their DNA-methylated allele. In the placenta, the paternal silencing along the Kcnq1 domain on distal chromosome 7 also correlates with the presence of H3-K9 methylation, but imprinted repression at these genes is maintained independently of DNA methylation. To explore which histone methyltransferase (HMT) could mediate the allelic H3-K9 methylation on distal chromosome 7, and at ICRs, we generated mouse conceptuses deficient for the SET domain protein G9a. We found that in the embryo and placenta, the differential DNA methylation at ICRs and imprinted genes is maintained in the absence of G9a. Accordingly, in embryos, imprinted gene expression was unchanged at the domains analyzed, in spite of a global loss of H3-K9 dimethylation (H3K9me2). In contrast, the placenta-specific imprinting of genes on distal chromosome 7 is impaired in the absence of G9a, and this correlates with reduced levels of H3K9me2 and H3K9me3. These findings provide the first evidence for the involvement of an HMT and suggest that histone methylation contributes to imprinted gene repression in the trophoblast.					121355	1618	84779	1026	4879	7980	5161	56000	116173	1080	43849	84076	136991

Type 1 iodothyronine deiodinase (Dio1), a selenoenzyme catalyzing the bioactivation of thyroid hormone, is highly expressed in the liver. Dio1 mRNA and enzyme activity levels are markedly reduced in the livers of hepatocyte nuclear factor 4alpha (HNF4alpha)-null mice, thus accounting for its liver-specific expression. Consistent with this deficiency, serum T4 and rT3 concentrations are elevated in these mice compared with those in HNF4alpha-floxed control littermates; however, serum T3 levels are unchanged. Promoter analysis of the mouse Dio1 gene demonstrated that HNF4alpha plays a key role in the transactivation of the mouse Dio1 gene. Deletion and substitution mutation analyses demonstrated that a proximal HNF4alpha site (direct repeat 1 [TGGACAAAGGTGC]; HNF4alpha-RE) is crucial for transactivation of the mouse Dio1 gene by HNF4alpha. Mouse Dio1 is also stimulated by thyroid hormone signaling, but a direct role for thyroid hormone receptor action has not been reported. We also showed that thyroid hormone-inducible Krüppel-like factor 9 (KLF9) stimulates the mouse Dio1 promoter very efficiently through two CACCC sequences that are located on either side of HNF4alpha-RE. Furthermore, KLF9 functions together with HNF4alpha and GATA4 to synergistically activate the mouse Dio1 promoter, suggesting that Dio1 is regulated by thyroid hormone in the mouse through an indirect mechanism requiring prior KLF9 induction. In addition, we showed that physical interactions between the C-terminal zinc finger domain (Cf) of GATA4 and activation function 2 of HNF4alpha and between the basic domain adjacent to Cf of GATA4 and a C-terminal domain of KLF9 are both required for this synergistic response. Taken together, these results suggest that HNF4alpha regulates thyroid hormone homeostasis through transcriptional regulation of the mouse Dio1 gene with GATA4 and KLF9.					1510	145957	5243	761	256586	4616	225	1672	57535	6783	51302	2934	948	6906	10231	3306	25797	2947	51179	10628	641371	2013	79993	291	23676	312	10561	5890	5166	6517	3953	5873	29968	11274	3557	55332	780	654790	8842	126969	7436	2328	376497	8863

Taken together, these results suggest that HNF4alpha regulates thyroid hormone homeostasis through transcriptional regulation of the mouse Dio1 gene with GATA4 and KLF9.					283927	2166	6472	5169	58510	3294	27141	11309	55388	432	1644	344	763	3781	727910	2706	54537	6281	8564	161291	6291	55937	3273	7172	79814	377841	570	1956	10249	2160	8418	8435	1757	18	5176	1733	114770	9970	55532	7036	5009	64577	4547	23498	8708	121214	6519	116285	5959	13	5267	3990	634	167127	54363	5918	2642	55244	126282	622	2165	282679	64333	1582	722	1512	5919	84647	212	389434	10864	6309	64065	54	80270	26007	8777	23474	9075	8858	64168	123688	91662	124044	127	2644	5174	10786	125488	50865	285440	731	84879	9963	23475	733	9076	337	8512	735	79905	3977	387755	7363	85414	171389	554235	5648	3556	729	221749	9420	8424	2065	368	10998	2161	3426	23683	9942	50507	220001	79799	1557	645638	6715	83641	5833	145264	7980	1572	5265	6694	732	883	1370	51166	56670	343	2169	4153	27284	147	161247	93550	114571	83401	375775	3078

To investigate the mechanism underlying this phenomenon, we have determined the effect of Mbd2 deficiency upon the phenotypes imposed by the conditional deletion of Apc in the small intestine. Microarray analysis demonstrated a partial suppression of the Wnt pathway in the absence of Mbd2. Mbd2 deficiency also influenced one immediate cellular consequence of Apc loss, with normalization of Paneth cell positioning. From a mechanistic perspective, we show that deficiency of Mbd2 elevates levels of the known Wnt target Lect2, and we confirm here that Mbd2 binds the Lect2 promoter in association with NuRD.

While a number of DNA binding transcription factors have been identified that control hematopoietic cell fate decisions, only a limited number of transcriptional corepressors (e.g., the retinoblastoma protein [pRB] and the nuclear hormone corepressor [N-CoR]) have been linked to these functions. Here, we show that the transcriptional corepressor Mtg16 (myeloid translocation gene on chromosome 16), which is targeted by t(16;21) in acute myeloid leukemia, is required for hematopoietic progenitor cell fate decisions and for early progenitor cell proliferation. Inactivation of Mtg16 skewed early myeloid progenitor cells toward the granulocytic/macrophage lineage while reducing the numbers of megakaryocyte-erythroid progenitor cells. In addition, inactivation of Mtg16 impaired the rapid expansion of short-term stem cells, multipotent progenitor cells, and megakaryocyte-erythroid progenitor cells that is required under hematopoietic stress/emergency. This impairment appears to be a failure to proliferate rather than an induction of cell death, as expression of c-Myc, but not Bcl2, complemented the Mtg16(-/-) defect.					5336	8288	55332	79668	30818	23268	2644	50615	2997	24146	8851	3292	613	3240	388585	389840	374907	29967	10855	79639	8909	83699	2999	59339	92922	220963	338339	6919	147645	221421	79816	3382	84912	57509	55117	387695	92370	6036	284417	56977	55859	55258	5273	397	288	10783	8495	10148	4689	80760	5795	9459	166929	9633	25876	202243	4616	26033	5473	79148	5732	27128	254240	9934	143888	54790	84569	2867	80205	2637	9641	51303	10279	894	89797	5480	9754	80896	222487	26996	3818	1573	834	3397	64651	9002	80820	3101	5027	79948	6404	22797	57194	81622	149465	122618	25777	978	8477	225	9950	9563	9057	51317	7485	144501	53346	9052	146894	5742	219736	55013	253782	27141	80263	10663	7171	3001	80168	26253	63892	146853	6282	338707	2171	51523	9535	1992	54210	10062	8530	338773	962	259232	9452	4973	8997	10261	11228	10493	2212	2944	7349	79890	5553	6948	160364	23400	115677	3290	55151	57412	64778	3543	3176	285671	7132	8895	6590	134266	28232	6709	90952	351	2672	283229	5588	3117	8985	3664	23157	3875	64123	2892	140706	55075	25816	3855	23423	10865	167359	3212	811	94274	3929	1831	9498	57210	79630	306	5138	401258	8091	442361	5873	1991	8972	2946	9886	2149	11279	9181	3417	7770	126353	4004	9153	2321	2151	7561	1075	10235	79660	211	3248	84329	11034	400668	2081	9580	51330	100134938	715	8522	56605	54874	91768	50650	5066	2947	2203	115361	308	8835	10312	55314	6688	84706	7010	266727	3017	2766	59338	23670	445	79971	91283	3084	241	3568	6997	3067	145957	79364	84529	80177	283652	28970	84174	2585	1791	10659	7111	50853	4242	51101	9331	85480	55809	6752	11031	79895	4647	932	79847	192683	79993	140679	79772	28231	25801	55636	10332	30845	11067	84343	7805	81563	3707	1979	5055	7045	143458	4688	4210	10462	388	201305	1828	4258	2124	27097	11033	5874	100131755	3945	6915	84959	4854	55198	5223	29909	7018	8612	23348	23433	112399	80216	10394	5896	26499	57161	3936	115761	122622	5625	26056	1489	1511	6711	113791	2681	11030	6504	7852	5657	375449	5899	1051	2162	152926	8573	9625	1524	1844	55103	2012	4818	8549	947	1879	57120	730249	10267	8778	3948	85014	2159	22823	497189	54436	117583	22918	23621	5478	100131451	23601	1053	9619	9454	342372	7274	51088	340061	57134	2213	125488	80319	91860	9926	59269	134265	404093	1241	2674	29802	28966

Notch signaling plays a key role in various cell differentiation processes including bone homeostasis. However, the specific involvement of Notch in regulating osteoclastogenesis is still controversial. In the present study, we show that RANKL induces expression of Jagged1 and Notch2 in bone marrow macrophages during osteoclast differentiation. Suppression of Notch signaling by a selective gamma-secretase inhibitor or Notch2 short hairpin RNA suppresses RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis. In contrast, induction of Notch signaling by Jagged1 or by ectopic expression of intracellular Notch2 enhances NFATc1 promoter activity and expression and promotes osteoclastogenesis. Finally, we found that Notch2 and p65 interact in the nuclei of RANKL-stimulated cells and that both proteins are recruited to the NFATc1 promoter, driving its expression. Taken together, our results show a new molecular cross talk between Notch and NF-kappaB pathways that is relevant in osteoclastogenesis.					8600	54567	799	4855	3516	182	23462	4853	28514	52	4851	10683	3714	3280	4772	4854

Here, we discovered a dramatic decrease in the area of calcification, new bone, and the number of osteocytes in calvaria from AR-deficient mice related to a reduction in mineralization caused, in part, by the diminished activity of AR-deficient osteoblasts. Enforced AR expression in differentiated osteoblasts boosts mineralization while knockdown of AR expression prevents androgen-induced mineralization. We identified the tissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase (TNSALP) and several members of small integrin binding ligand N-linked glycoprotein (SIBLING) gene family as androgen target genes required for AR-mediated bone formation. We show that inorganic phosphate (P(i)) levels and TNSALP activity increased in response to androgen/AR and P(i) signals increase the expression and translocation of AR.

File: TERcomparison.xls: red			Mouse430A_2	Arthur Liberzon	Broad Institute	Genes up-regulated in erythroid progenitor cells from fetal livers of E13.5 embryos with KLF1 [GeneID=10661] knockout compared to those from the wild type embryos.	Erythroid Krüppel-like factor (EKLF) is a Krüppel-like transcription factor identified as a transcriptional activator and chromatin modifier in erythroid cells. EKLF-deficient (Eklf(-/-)) mice die at day 14.5 of gestation from severe anemia. In this study, we demonstrate that early progenitor cells fail to undergo terminal erythroid differentiation in Eklf(-/-) embryos. To discover potential EKLF target genes responsible for the failure of erythropoiesis, transcriptional profiling was performed with RNA from wild-type and Eklf(-/-) early erythroid progenitor cells. These analyses identified significant perturbation of a network of genes involved in cell cycle regulation, with the critical regulator of the cell cycle, E2f2, at a hub. E2f2 mRNA and protein levels were markedly decreased in Eklf(-/-) early erythroid progenitor cells, which showed a delay in the G(1)-to-S-phase transition. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis demonstrated EKLF occupancy at the proximal E2f2 promoter in vivo. Consistent with the role of EKLF as a chromatin modifier, EKLF binding sites in the E2f2 promoter were located in a region of EKLF-dependent DNase I sensitivity in early erythroid progenitor cells. We propose a model in which EKLF-dependent activation and modification of the E2f2 locus is required for cell cycle progression preceding terminal erythroid differentiation.					1282	375743	29110	54832	10060	286205	402682	3671	339105	710	60681	56172	6376	55089	57530	252839	23556	84061	55156	759	375790	255967	1510	3792	3083	9730	10062	7286	29789	63027	2243	55384	54455	1000	22884	283677	23093	3674	84909	6504	115106	7102	5414	2719	1601	8774	7078	9899	5917	3172	56946	51251	60	7837	3035	7481	7204	6197	7365	93986	2791	64840	6383	4154	5345	10797	462	5178	7884	10335	669	646743	56913	140809	7855	57728	2219	8685	26091	6911	214	7504	8500	4017	90957	727	51365	4026	81490	259230	22996	1406	9325	2017	2324	230	53981	23076	90952	2201	3105	1525	203447	55589	1401	57715	5325	91461	25942	3856	3300	336	3549	4297	1277	84668	6535	444	8678	51631	6622	3008	2182	8038	167153	55450	11080	55754	3485	335	5445	4673	1179	161829	3048	1191	54552	22936	55320	84171	440145	8321	7450	26275	57231	55500	23608	5087	28996	9735	154796	5376	1990	81552	26499	1290	64785	9710	26005	1301	23403	1003	239	129642	23002	6453	5870	1196	866	892	57680	219539	55317	55532	50807	2060	2147	10398	257407	54812	1540	148534	255043	3698	26010	4300	56648	7779	1278	9969	63893	664	3162	51193	9411	23369	25820	3481	5576	51186	9452	552900	9564	2335	288	140576	8714	6708	4638	174	3827	55291	4692	283375	79074	64328	1565	285527	85439	165	338	1852	11167	6430	9101	79589	6482	9388	10395	26058	23185	1910	51701	54551	57644	9953	84364	1452	3950	80315	51156	7276	57669	712	5947	128989	10495	64285	3321	28989	6833	871	10867	2690	2880	23637	10351	57153	23438	904	10181	59352	10107	5498	64172	10531	800	5420	212	1281	51257	8187	350	29062	173	291	9962	55196	10363	163732	5648	55897	9185	6678	1292	9371	5950	8788	25831	57589	55968	9500	57019	6764	4489	5609	54437	9429	733	3643	57129	27102	2038	56852	25966	27329	10724	8727	80031	84163	3836	81027	9609	9663	3484	643155	10928	79083	6694	1182	22795	51283	2627	9159	23286	23259	10082	9869	7018	8544	3267	6641	3697	23446	54536	55937	79962	1850	2235	5357	11001	23122	56254	213	10059	388931	93974	3313	4060	5373	1760	11198	5500	64116	3547	23160	53371	5937	55206	79814	3157	25907	696	5789	2244	2	51665	128338	3249	3796	8660	7153	54855	51111	57447	6916	7073	114804	441282	80351	165918	27252	51147	284434	7448	7049	6921	154810	2730	5577	2982	64326	8309	79627	5792	13	1280	633	5473	51085	1634	197	8928	2266	163259	51663	2263	79057	54468	7003	10781	80781	131566	5340	92689	93587	51239	100271873	9874	26751	57708	7756	93624	259	57534	5858	5095	3699	84164	80349	25789	129303	53944	1184	482	4023	55252	5362	389	79933	378938	8436	79905	5787	3480	26268	114876	123787	3553	93183	121256	8863	54883	79847	7468	2887	4481	1432	8828	8301	3426	5311	8833	2167	19	125150	8036	92359	2309	10075	7412	55576	10486	4193	4237	10634	10205	10979	57148	79959	28514	24140	9941	1737	2638	2966	9213	285672	494143	3046	7763	3676	285852	4735	3263	6259	84955	55728	4199	1041	2321	55466	7373	10186

Erythroid Krüppel-like factor (EKLF) is a Krüppel-like transcription factor identified as a transcriptional activator and chromatin modifier in erythroid cells. EKLF-deficient (Eklf(-/-)) mice die at day 14.5 of gestation from severe anemia. In this study, we demonstrate that early progenitor cells fail to undergo terminal erythroid differentiation in Eklf(-/-) embryos. To discover potential EKLF target genes responsible for the failure of erythropoiesis, transcriptional profiling was performed with RNA from wild-type and Eklf(-/-) early erythroid progenitor cells. These analyses identified significant perturbation of a network of genes involved in cell cycle regulation, with the critical regulator of the cell cycle, E2f2, at a hub. E2f2 mRNA and protein levels were markedly decreased in Eklf(-/-) early erythroid progenitor cells, which showed a delay in the G(1)-to-S-phase transition. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis demonstrated EKLF occupancy at the proximal E2f2 promoter in vivo. Consistent with the role of EKLF as a chromatin modifier, EKLF binding sites in the E2f2 promoter were located in a region of EKLF-dependent DNase I sensitivity in early erythroid progenitor cells. We propose a model in which EKLF-dependent activation and modification of the E2f2 locus is required for cell cycle progression preceding terminal erythroid

Phosphorylation is important in p53-mediated DNA damage responses. After UV irradiation, p53 is phosphorylated specifically at murine residue Ser389. Phosphorylation mutant p53.S389A cells and mice show reduced apoptosis and compromised tumor suppression after UV irradiation. We investigated the underlying cellular processes by time-series analysis of UV-induced gene expression responses in wild-type, p53.S389A, and p53(-/-) mouse embryonic fibroblasts. The absence of p53.S389 phosphorylation already causes small endogenous gene expression changes for 2,253, mostly p53-dependent, genes. These genes showed basal gene expression levels intermediate to the wild type and p53(-/-), possibly to readjust the p53 network. Overall, the p53.S389A mutation lifts p53-dependent gene repression to a level similar to that of p53(-/-) but has lesser effect on p53-dependently induced genes. In the wild type, the response of 6,058 genes to UV irradiation was strictly biphasic. The early stress response, from 0 to 3 h, results in the activation of processes to prevent the accumulation of DNA damage in cells, whereas the late response, from 12 to 24 h, relates more to reentering the cell cycle. Although the p53.S389A UV gene response was only subtly changed, many cellular processes were significantly affected. The early response was affected the most, and many cellular processes were phase-specifically lost, gained, or altered, e.g., induction of apoptosis, cell division, and DNA repair, respectively. Altogether, p53.S389 phosphorylation seems essential for many p53 target genes and p53-dependent processes.					79605	26872	81691	79567	23140	889	116842	81501	10369	6253	85445	727800	390760	5023	1272	29958	64180	137797	3679	11136	81887	27076	692076	390	169044	3291	57337	134147	3680	26287	2565	22931	8808	847	261729	10280	763	59269	83606	5864	51231	3625	1723	442117	4644	9167	4322	347344	9196	54520	3818	5150	1959	84294	3654	24141	59341	3001	8110	312	9340	25904	4099	51031	55824	4336	8671	148014	80818	57124	23463	201140	84071	9388	10652	10235	7462	3293	1213	64843	196743	40	7991	4216	124995	253512	10000	51450	9965	9648	2039	284110	51011	90506	9920	54550	11095	7104	51237	8986	56605	359845	258010	57863	203259	255043	257407	60673	146310	5727	55890	56034	4363	116173	55084	8930	9014	115939	1826	779	65975	161582	474358	255027	9750	121551	387521	22902	50486	23217	91860	23242	55088	443	863	119587	153396	26060	79853	6750	151963	114884	5175	80727	399	3984	55345	3232	58498	8395	10207	5644	8744	54958	5520	4358	5451	79618	63948	2785	4430	79085	51586	170680	58529	401251	5521	133686	58503	202051	6567	1601	339983	64430	8541	64768	120237	53904	54885	83988	340146	9363	9725	374928	7371	126206	84107	59307	4832	25814	22918	80736	5321	5368	7099	51375	4051	8763	340527	80034	23743	6005	7138	7003	81029	144193	5891	167691	596	9246	256714	4917	55195	133491	54793	136647	4036	9931	919	7070	23636	7273	79813	4259	1361	23244	89849	11254	50650	767	389549	23170	1215	9878	10093	401612	10140	83892	726	10964	129080	2731	3950	4091	152007	83460	89910	64067	197259	26011	64115	55028	54749	710	64123	58477	389075	6827	5584	490	112840	341880	1271	7474	5756	79663	55303	7096	8642	85301	5295	9371	30001	23312	5116	56925	56927	4208	3822	9252	4882	27163	1302	411	80114	8291	4861	140578	10627	6383	5597	54502	969	119	56656	80167	321	56155	776	6844	54664	136895	11137	2208	221044	29841	100271873	23042	85442	53844	9427	153768	9037	345930	1909	1056	2555	26585	9948	23237	780	3678	5118	387694	4214	4900	249	5789	27443	93	486	442425	6664	54941	10317	337	6532	6769	8751	1264	1047	663	23508	55017	85352	27141	124925	28954	2790	687	27092	64841	932	5618	55384	8406	100499435	57228	288	822	57761	23597	389827	54503	151242	53616	92400	353134	1510	375790	151516	30813	1465	3718	84181	254439	7029	55339	64285	1834	54414	11278	115908	122809	999	29957	51112	435	2775	135138	871	83594	79656	2793	10900	390010	79008	10955	55676	11031	29118	3799	5348	420	2597	151556	1418	252995	1489	653	26084	3759	55286	7265	9024	8820	349136	6622	81615	27250	84623	85440	7473	6376	10867	79096	11260	23268	10692	2280	129303	338440	2717	7188	9732	30851	256586	64101	9249	7221	3384	1409	64109	604	1081	3565	57214	6783	64122	57224	390084	9655	114798	116519	2628	1583	146547	80344	9546	9892	1603	3767	732206	79006	79879	419	84167	9254	150084	197	51014	6736	1672	6892	10850	5010	389084	11080	1801	83463	81892	2296	3221	643008	374739	26137	176	85027	817	59272	6366	29063	57085	56965	83639	115827	59	3998	7351	54788	59342	126353	64714	60686	84708	28996	3891	636	5187	57402	1595	80005	26010	79007	284098	401190	8557	137492	80896	2781	79707	53822	3170	134864	55997	10410	8288	54464	400746	202243	50863	759	170961	29966	89777	8991	25975	440193	27344	57084	3995	5877	85407	954	467	55891	651746	6483	130106	57662	1580	27164	8870	325	81285	85397	408	646627	115704	667	1365	706	10894	10199	7799	123811	8443	63943	100129480	11228	51187	3081	387263	79877	6049	50632	55163	100133311	3371	9241	4134	89866	80864	8526	23071	3304	3694	147741	8412	6590	2908	5362	63976	10116	29110	89953	2853	51477	6752	126638	10678	1326	3868	25999	2001	3815	4641	5881	64598	340260	6674	27095	65266	377841	338328	116068	10396	3885	2125	7289	55317	3658	5077	55614	81833	2760	22943	4693	1991	961	5454	3671	340371	316	4783	5588	84940	51806	7475	2262	55177	27345	9737	8913	4128	57572	283446	55351	9839	5469	124857	29855	4915	23566	7036	64919	10158	1051	2962	27122	94025	5167	1475	128506	51478	89	23014	283537	58508	55182	58488	286343	3036	79136	57535	340348	3899	10023	53919	1511	79140	50805	85413	1113	7010	9527	255231	729330	1208	129804	55630	1463	10734	7532	148327	128861	57451	23786	6677	7803	6604	399968	144347	10960	134187	9779	81533	2946	9079	4160	79443	54	25802	1160	54674	10382	51676	51531	59344	28316	202333	1121	170261	2815	4643	121441	8942	340485	221303	5739	55640	2952	1717	8100	10857	219621	80326	1604	57213	54778	285382	487	4826	9745	9495	2318	3674	2625	1305	7095	64318	8693	54810	23228	84978	7549	118932	51776	80223	56926	1412	2330	3612	340351	148867	170575	54437	7314	51412	5602	84901	90780	11197	7412	23048	64718	136	388588	23040	4645	6050	23030	55327	127687	23263	22919	285671	8061	26996	79412	84688	387597	26024	229	1188	54741	4634	6440	717	116064	54471	375323	55102	9223	6375	4148	3263	290	53841	3710	7007	30011	55105	55937	622	4703	3753	643	140467	3299	3780	54856	168544	11329	7448	80274	26470	3316	23224	149603	3859	284348	23765	56123	203286	54922	9620	57165	1545	23129	5089	23350	84525	85007	51778	92162	54828	859	342865	84684	254778	386618	283131	9453	6261	55154	121512	1917	2623	55300	51150	84867	25953	5239	3937	112487	55930	283807	65082	10125	8477	429	6692	84309	56999	815

Phosphorylation is important in p53-mediated DNA damage responses. After UV irradiation, p53 is phosphorylated specifically at murine residue Ser389. Phosphorylation mutant p53.S389A cells and mice show reduced apoptosis and compromised tumor suppression after UV irradiation. We investigated the underlying cellular processes by time-series analysis of UV-induced gene expression responses in wild-type, p53.S389A, and p53(-/-) mouse embryonic fibroblasts. The absence of p53.S389 phosphorylation already causes small endogenous gene expression changes for 2,253, mostly p53-dependent, genes. These genes showed basal gene expression levels intermediate to the wild type and p53(-/-), possibly to readjust the p53 network. Overall, the p53.S389A mutation lifts p53-dependent gene repression to a level similar to that of p53(-/-) but has lesser effect on p53-dependently induced genes. In the wild type, the response of 6,058 genes to UV irradiation was strictly biphasic. The early stress response, from 0 to 3 h, results in the activation of processes to prevent the accumulation of DNA damage in cells, whereas the late response, from 12 to 24 h, relates more to reentering the cell cycle. Although the p53.S389A UV gene response was only subtly changed, many cellular processes were significantly affected. The early response was affected the most, and many cellular processes were phase-specifically lost, gained, or altered, e.g., induction of apoptosis, cell division, and DNA repair, respectively. Altogether, p53.S389 phosphorylation seems essential for many p53 target genes and p53-dependent processes.					54805	26576	1032	10804	2842	29979	5244	51426	255426	2999	27044	9479	81493	338391	167410	64319	11072	1969	649	6609	5826	133957	10462	51313	5270	3588	5119	375790	1840	131965	8554	55332	224	9994	9113	11339	65009	7114	5281	55974	3934	8425	369	128414	9111	3480	5970	7180	1073	10559	5743	8745	83643	26257	301	56905	6035	7041	55051	139728	5069	643394	84335	2070	26074	10553	9722	4803	10215	219844	64859	1300	57214	1241	25819	3108	114984	4856	5768	1728	3303	59084	100132916	79345	654434	4240	55103	5580	80854	6263	84695	1318	112802	374	8993	81572	2532	80320	84975	113419	60487	83903	57326	4814	5973	9610	4703	51181	5992	11185	55840	10193	5631	2629	10209	6676	1294	8438	875	57804	10558	92689	53358	9475	960	85364	158234	10669	29880	7551	222826	57403	51246	138050	5897	7005	3628	4435	7163	56937	6324	5024	4802	6120	114131	2113	388272	4791	284612	3164	64838	6277	10019	643155	143282	132299	10912	9415	1951	56160	2042	3169	5409	7832	223117	11098	738	4615	7077	51668	2073	6678	4285	4323	126432	9310	55589	175	2152	153562	4092	5156	29993	10745	2517	7542	9236	51715	1212	4054	23646	9437	84560	90411	30814	6275	1263	55500	114879	5657	253738	7466	80219	92293	5310	2327	10487	1397	80313	26100	1371	55192	55508	7525	4547	54757	6990	2027	91966	6574	22858	5366	55107	23048	151194	5950	4488	50509	5329	652968	26136	283431	1778	8722	8408	9200	8553	360023	154791	244	64834	6634	11280	10950	10201	3792	55013	6656	2239	57158	3589	1145	148223	9961	54587	79647	146542	2791	3569	114990	81559	93183	3728	10612	390058	27134	79639	222643	29035	51226	170302	56961	3914	79623	83855	51272	26147	1308	197335	51092	122786	54065	51421	254295	387923	26064	79026	113189	166793	4247	1154	7252	128025	112849	284106	2354	92840	7402	7008	4035	8878	26270	57657	254956	9782	6505	1687	2892	64218	64423	79589	84163	3964	51170	6314	399949	344657	55353	5054	8840	8482	9378	60370	79899	51652	64224	3713	165	29115	8856	813	9034	54480	165057	53838	5606	23417	54918	91614	1839	3507	51125	6261	51297	835	2649	65110	56992	23197	728	6037	7079	57515	55350	51460	9695	7037	55839	3242	56654	124790	3239	114987	1463	25945	22800	116254	2767	7355	84962	27111	317	79746	5025	6206	10626	196463	80700	7498	64321	53616	5268	10758	3976	79017	112869	6455	79657	1848	286451	858	9848	6303	140462	1833	8915	5207	306	55565	384	6698	154	1287	9208	3257	5100	6004	26260	56898	22999	6444	51330	57538	1316	5476	1282	11186	3563	7056	440026	51259	63874	27034	2275	80764	9963	8633	56261	3337	64577	351	55652	64114	8900	116154	1676	3006	79586	54329	114790	389058	7975	56667	3601	90637	140809	91663	90025	5238	10663	26262	10668	5062	9531	26224	54785	427	284654	26239	51734	55220	23011	2888	5055	3683	10580	79962	10858	54544	66004	154810	8115	26272	56001	417	10156	2069	81788	79648	3851	80271	4973	57048	6891	84168	29126	64506	355	2246	23452	4646	3624	57455	221	345274	8301	64332	9569	1284	10397	11041	57132	1644	28973	944	23564	4314	3568	2561	29071	64782	9903	113444	1843	3004	3856	6399	23551	5754	6943	6854	27075	8742	113791	6789	6817	1490	6560	283692	64129	23563	387119	9244	607	79571	8795	64407	4982	11130	56683	4256	201931	2052	7006	6696	2937	202052	80853	56246

processes.					23759	4257	10328	51606	128864	388564	1390	471	6642	4624	5934	3605	5142	10469	1633	10286	439921	27153	6835	2628	23173	4017	7169	64787	201931	8555	80318	2596	9619	80790	6558	399949	9848	29911	51060	112487	79075	2483	10130	79603	55752	10098	10398	51292	79833	6586	9674	1201	23576	8835	374	10874	51182	5236	64094	9694	7371	53407	79184	79987	58	29099	5781	5127	10627	2643	80270	26284	79960	9255	4287	80714	79823	137682	55761	9441	11091	5700	6845	51752	54987	51072	4482	219333	8504	256281	55750	788	8745	10010	2707	950	7249	84695	55291	114757	127534	5110	5058	23463	56672	125488	4637	4811	56945	10910	2239	3860	27247	2339	7837	26575	79169	79701	51451	23137	7846	10516	4644	9804	79096	5593	1278	301	5796	55902	5701	27159	11123	6464	10238	51594	55697	51205	55852	7980	10150	65082	2999	9815	6242	3691	6314	53834	26151	64146	8874	1859	8910	8045	10421	3093	79017	7403	64172	5272	65993	79729	4864	132299	27303	2512	166929	377677	10282	5422	27429	403	11252	85440	1290	2932	3717	9573	6885	3910	51621	4694	55268	958	6403	5983	374768	5806	168090	79657	4817	4664	401494	374618	8611	54815	83660	2653	653333	55850	5557	411	55500	6480	902	54938	9391	5271	22853	131566	26574	1489	6251	23216	112936	857	5427	11127	6895	51149	79005	10007	55652	348995	9896	26585	57045	5243	117157	200576	6921	55339	10402	388364	28512	56994	1381	51501	51465	92335	55654	4285	9723	5898	51444	54884	91408	25979	8445	8607	64426	57409	84898	120526	51531	134957	9138	64175	9325	54858	79682	5033	387119	51027	8487	841	22795	5922	51019	7058	81570	9869	4923	94101	9936	8028	8087	28952	5310	163786	10213	55907	128061	8624	91828	9111	5716	4121	10553	114908	5682	51226	9553	23368	192683	51637	5954	8406	10459	3213	5718	55742	351	898	55105	84661	134637	9688	56287	8309	11255	136647	60490	823	6810	23787	54927	26012	4628	79661	285973	27352	55308	83716	10254	51347	84154	8405	5802	5096	1301	83607	10043	51719	5728	3208	10791	1293	1291	255758	51377	1604	26993	119391	6236	54414	57489	6366	2887	755	79447	9463	4913	53938	926	83475	55164	7009	8813	6908	8076	197370	84333	79697	151887	55207	56413	5723	604	4665	10001	114990	10229	54474	9353	402055	2331	3868	10541	79080	2954	152098	25984	200916	79980	79991	57217	54584	51573	26499	56941	79719	1289	10054	6632	64769	63916	9342	5935	80331	9338	4659	64789	2041	10597	81873	22949	9135	2241	55856	5764	10954	10556	114883	27122	2027	29101	168667	10535	51741	1656	2321	143888	51534	4629	27018	56265	51227	92689	6920	10239	51067	1854	1525	4301	55384	84680	6892	6925	5191	3613	84869	4703	284254	4803	55110	51031	8692	4174	201176	2683	91894	1277	5034	128	158234	56942	51611	51256	529	51319	150864	5471	2963	51028	5578	29979	375686	119710	617	23582	3801	2709	55274	1967	406	7410	7087	55278	1800	26270	54878	81572	56616	10311	142891	23309	28988	7168	3090	831	5303	1159	4837	90293	6468	2677	9582	894	6683	729756	80755	93323	7266	25923	4969	475	23268	3859	1465	51294	23180	23387	2280	84296	8318	28957	6737	1241	5118	4140	26230	1612	30968	285	4534	58505	10609	54962	389125	9641	54829	150383	2874	10652	9482	71	9209	5891	7048	11235	84100	5831	952	57406	27109	25849	9183	55008	23362	55529	7481	9380	5358	493861	7385	57154	2690	5797	375260	4319	84645	64965	9610	9016	85403	8481	55660	84617	4836	4857	55930	805	54996	7690	80114	10036	7084	3241	64105	4173	201161	29088	85451	55466	10628	55072	8482	25793	2059	7424	4170	10404	1145	1317	10370	440603	134145	282991	80230	132160	7045	79685	5685	10558	5978	55220	113235	4835	5036	4884	2184	57003	3113	6013	11194	4436	80224	5147	6789	29090	26269	7337	29980	4015	54805	91057	8510	64777	10953	84717	51010	7175	84939	3964	9051	55471	79814	5621	10941	51124	84879	79641	54810	219738	3949	889	135114	8034	57534	4147	5862	728637	1730	85302	4734	55862	22920	23008	55326	1606	6422	23607	55034	283871	5166	79629	51316	60	84962	54472	25960	2717	10363	7031	4647	10952	10533	55356	5209	3297	51661	221504	3251	57679	23417	84324	222658	283446	369	55114	534	10801	10605	170712	7039	644	55325	7004	51099	84286	10161	3430	6888	23446	11164	36	23192	9978	1303	113419	55298	54828	84164	157378	10428	55726	5307	53340	51397	4327	10969	79644	4331	28958	23384	81631	51569	84976	27131	775	51023	51012	57537	7320	63910	23435	1488	27120	387263	22803	10249	84058	5886	51102	55647	51586	11051	8091	528	7283	7991	51129	51115	9415	440193	2335	3265	1025	64241	64149	25861	7251	3840	9589	79026	59	146562	55723	10237	6699	9748	1794	388	100505767	7936	5473	54926	3600	59344	53838	219793	10491	51118	100127983	51313	124540	1523	84268	8073	6249	115908	2098	2906	51409	1284	4439	3004	444	154	23075	57821	5888	81609	64943	2168	55365	5818	1474	113189	441282	4234	7164	1264	27123	3163	55715	51382	11098	25830	375189	51571	1207	30844	11031	80347	7172	7071	81610	23600	4722	84267	29074	23673	1855	29842	122553	8703	55240	22999	57724	92421	5187	646862	10914	5019	84064	84958	3337	79068	11099	55785	5984	51654	8425	5686	131965	8795	51231	137392	25943	55041	84883	57696	202052	659	158	9497	64374	55168	84263	389203	55144	29089	93081	2131	80851	375061	9957	11284	4016	57150	2539	4054	23471	256949	4342	9232	55863	91703

Phosphorylation is important in p53-mediated DNA damage responses. After UV irradiation, p53 is phosphorylated specifically at murine residue Ser389. Phosphorylation mutant p53.S389A cells and mice show reduced apoptosis and compromised tumor suppression after UV irradiation. We investigated the underlying cellular processes by time-series analysis of UV-induced gene expression responses in wild-type, p53.S389A, and p53(-/-) mouse embryonic fibroblasts. The absence of p53.S389 phosphorylation already causes small endogenous gene expression changes for 2,253, mostly p53-dependent, genes. These genes showed basal gene expression levels intermediate to the wild type and p53(-/-), possibly to readjust the p53 network. Overall, the p53.S389A mutation lifts p53-dependent gene repression to a level similar to that of p53(-/-) but has lesser effect on p53-dependently induced genes. In the wild type, the response of 6,058 genes to UV irradiation was strictly biphasic. The early stress response, from 0 to 3 h, results in the activation of processes to prevent the accumulation of DNA damage in cells, whereas the late response, from 12 to 24 h, relates more to reentering the cell cycle. Although the p53.S389A UV gene response was only subtly changed, many cellular processes were significantly affected. The early response was affected the most, and many cellular processes were phase-specifically lost, gained, or altered, e.g., induction of apoptosis, cell division, and DNA repair, respectively. Altogether, p53.S389 phosphorylation seems essential for many p53 target genes and p53-dependent processes.					3037	9317	8880	26018	79064	11277	94032	2055	10663	56919	11072	26811	23524	5706	57659	93973	84640	26973	6445	81605	6472	1876	124944	6095	79173	6793	1154	5594	51141	28992	5291	122769	57111	55691	4035	163486	401207	9156	4091	151188	79023	84303	26277	56888	26271	51029	7392	84913	4597	29915	732	7181	5452	55122	57102	127428	23024	2974	64805	57504	10500	11259	55177	5771	1592	2125	29970	1741	117177	4678	28966	4908	29855	54778	23291	80824	3480	8192	8661	25876	56986	57559	8030	118924	8412	7286	340061	55788	81620	398	84142	135927	64096	151525	23640	10138	55844	79058	23483	23174	10383	222484	56984	92906	57214	22921	80329	200558	140733	9444	9021	6760	5825	80314	79720	80821	306	79026	54455	55676	113026	89853	10572	23469	10253	90	3741	23370	27030	23613	84108	1871	79000	283927	84246	4703	51322	29937	83449	25836	80862	56261	6741	54863	25820	29123	125988	27077	333	10735	1894	9625	2622	60682	344875	7273	2617	23028	79897	9994	349565	4528	83593	9166	64110	6218	51053	134510	51016	9425	91298	2043	11266	11330	64750	25906	6585	6913	51174	79752	91801	10217	27257	4130	92162	10008	51530	25843	353116	54984	10180	79677	11107	390	9422	6496	11020	6901	653140	8832	345611	51720	27430	29887	9126	6871	54602	64784	9134	10040	4610	128710	6224	23197	51388	3776	654434	6992	22950	348235	2119	3475	3241	58487	800	2242	376940	57654	6506	5318	65123	10427	2672	4133	2878	84798	5782	27246	9647	84254	1964	55284	7326	10654	56946	117854	7726	10534	11248	51070	8815	57491	55005	79810	5819	9734	10580	22800	7597	91283	285193	388272	57544	100506581	55596	9517	129531	84517	735301	64422	5327	23528	8773	2898	9150	808	3839	375341	55172	546	6175	8445	138241	80745	285175	4833	114880	55544	8289	3607	1106	166336	55276	1479	23016	8266	55069	54476	55014	9392	79888	339	4134	51362	23054	81576	84919	56852	6399	50807	7289	8694	115098	7186	26984	3921	9698

Phosphorylation is important in p53-mediated DNA damage responses. After UV irradiation, p53 is phosphorylated specifically at murine residue Ser389. Phosphorylation mutant p53.S389A cells and mice show reduced apoptosis and compromised tumor suppression after UV irradiation. We investigated the underlying cellular processes by time-series analysis of UV-induced gene expression responses in wild-type, p53.S389A, and p53(-/-) mouse embryonic fibroblasts. The absence of p53.S389 phosphorylation already causes small endogenous gene expression changes for 2,253, mostly p53-dependent, genes. These genes showed basal gene expression levels intermediate to the wild type and p53(-/-), possibly to readjust the p53 network. Overall, the p53.S389A mutation lifts p53-dependent gene repression to a level similar to that of p53(-/-) but has lesser effect on p53-dependently induced genes. In the wild type, the response of 6,058 genes to UV irradiation was strictly biphasic. The early stress response, from 0 to 3 h, results in the activation of processes to prevent the accumulation of DNA damage in cells, whereas the late response, from 12 to 24 h, relates more to reentering the cell cycle. Although the p53.S389A UV gene response was only subtly changed, many cellular processes were significantly affected. The early response was affected the most, and many cellular processes were phase-specifically lost, gained, or altered, e.g., induction of apoptosis, cell division, and DNA repair, respectively.

Transcription factor ATF-2 is a nuclear target of stress-activated protein kinases, such as p38, which are activated by various extracellular stresses, including UV light. Here, we show that ATF-2 plays a critical role in hypoxia- and high-cell-density-induced apoptosis and the development of mammary tumors. Compared to wild-type cells, Atf-2(-/-) mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were more resistant to hypoxia- and anisomycin-induced apoptosis but remained equally susceptible to other stresses, including UV. Atf-2(-/-) and Atf-2(+/-) MEFs could not express a group of genes, such as Gadd45alpha, whose overexpression can induce apoptosis, in response to hypoxia. Atf-2(-/-) MEFs also had a higher saturation density than wild-type cells and expressed lower levels of Maspin, the breast cancer tumor suppressor, which is also known to enhance cellular sensitivity to apoptotic stimuli. Atf-2(-/-) MEFs underwent a lower degree of apoptosis at high cell density than wild-type cells. Atf-2(+/-) mice were highly prone to mammary tumors that expressed reduced levels of Gadd45alpha and Maspin. The ATF-2 mRNA levels in human breast cancers were lower than those in normal breast tissue. Thus, ATF-2 acts as a tumor susceptibility gene of mammary tumors, at least partly, by activating a group of target genes, including Maspin and Gadd45alpha.					2660	7546	2330	3360	27159	8653	1180	6510	1401	3543	57092	54832	9118	1232	26273	201161	7520	4184	6388	51804	435	10752	1269	57633

TFIID is a general transcription factor required for transcription of most protein-coding genes by RNA polymerase II. TAF7L is an X-linked germ cell-specific paralogue of TAF7, which is a generally expressed component of TFIID. Here, we report the generation of Taf7l mutant mice by homologous recombination in embryonic stem cells by using the Cre-loxP strategy. While spermatogenesis was completed in Taf7l(-/Y) mice, the weight of Taf7l(-/Y) testis decreased and the amount of sperm in the epididymides was sharply reduced. Mutant epididymal sperm exhibited abnormal morphology, including folded tails. Sperm motility was significantly reduced, and Taf7l(-/Y) males were fertile with reduced litter size. Microarray profiling revealed that the abundance of six gene transcripts (including Fscn1) in Taf7l(-/Y) testes decreased more than twofold. In particular, FSCN1 is an F-action-bundling protein and thus may be critical for normal sperm morphology and sperm motility. Although deficiency of Taf7l may be compensated in part by Taf7, Taf7l has apparently evolved new specialized functions in the gene-selective transcription in male germ cell differentiation. Our mouse studies suggest that mutations in the human TAF7L gene might be implicated in X-linked oligozoospermia in men.					113451	90355	115572	6624	57094	57713

PASINI_SUZ12_TARGETS_UP	M2291		17339329	Pasini D,Bracken AP,Hansen JB,Capillo M,Helin K		Table 1S: FC > 0			Mouse430A_2	Arthur Liberzon	Broad Institute	Genes up-regulated in ES (embryonic stem cells) with defficient SUZ12 [GeneID=23512].	Polycomb group (PcG) proteins form multiprotein complexes, called Polycomb repressive complexes (PRCs). PRC2 contains the PcG proteins EZH2, SUZ12, and EED and represses transcription through methylation of lysine (K) 27 of histone H3 (H3). Suz12 is essential for PRC2 activity and its inactivation results in early lethality of mouse embryos. Here, we demonstrate that Suz12(-/-) mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells can be established and expanded in tissue culture. The Suz12(-/-) ES cells are characterized by global loss of H3K27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) and higher expression levels of differentiation-specific genes. Moreover, Suz12(-/-) ES cells are impaired in proper differentiation, resulting in a lack of repression of ES cell markers as well as activation of differentiation-specific genes. Finally, we demonstrate that the PcGs are actively recruited to several genes during ES cell differentiation, which despite an increase in H3K27me3 levels is not always sufficient to prevent transcriptional activation. In summary, we demonstrate that Suz12 is required for the establishment of specific expression programs required for ES cell differentiation.

Polycomb group (PcG) proteins form multiprotein complexes, called Polycomb repressive complexes (PRCs). PRC2 contains the PcG proteins EZH2, SUZ12, and EED and represses transcription through methylation of lysine (K) 27 of histone H3 (H3). Suz12 is essential for PRC2 activity and its inactivation results in early lethality of mouse embryos. Here, we demonstrate that Suz12(-/-) mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells can be established and expanded in tissue culture. The Suz12(-/-) ES cells are characterized by global loss of H3K27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) and higher expression levels of differentiation-specific genes. Moreover, Suz12(-/-) ES cells are impaired in proper differentiation, resulting in a lack of repression of ES cell markers as well as activation of differentiation-specific genes. Finally, we demonstrate that the PcGs are actively recruited to several genes during ES cell differentiation, which despite an increase in H3K27me3 levels is not always sufficient to prevent transcriptional activation. In summary, we demonstrate that Suz12 is required for the establishment of specific expression programs required for ES cell differentiation.

The cooperation of stem cell factor (SCF) and erythropoietin (Epo) is required to induce renewal divisions in erythroid progenitors, whereas differentiation to mature erythrocytes requires the presence of Epo only. Epo and SCF activate common signaling pathways such as the activation of protein kinase B (PKB) and the subsequent phosphorylation and inactivation of Foxo3a. In contrast, only Epo activates Stat5. Both Foxo3a and Stat5 promote erythroid differentiation. To understand the interplay of SCF and Epo in maintaining the balance between renewal and differentiation during erythroid development, we investigated differential Foxo3a target regulation by Epo and SCF. Expression profiling revealed that a subset of Foxo3a targets was not inhibited but was activated by Epo. One of these genes was Cited2. Transcriptional control of Epo/Foxo3a-induced Cited2 was studied and compared with that of the Epo-repressed Foxo3a target Btg1. We show that in response to Epo, the allegedly growth-inhibitory factor Foxo3a associates with the allegedly growth-stimulatory factor Stat5 in the nucleus, which is required for Epo-induced Cited2 expression. In contrast, Btg1 expression is controlled by the cooperation of Foxo3a with cyclic AMP- and Jun kinase-dependent Creb family members. Thus, Foxo3a not only is an effector of PKB but also integrates distinct signals to regulate gene expression in erythropoiesis.					694	2892	1846	5229	1510	340260	53344	9689	150274	375035	1027	9934	10370	401207	23039	1439	57552	9236	140885	55802	4835	56521	3815	8408	94241	83606	81552	1634	27244	160518	538	483	283209	427	3480	271	383	4771	28511	113263	1316	1374	255394	114883	11034	80315	9990	65018	5997	81542	10908	901	2771	6414	7414	5934	1380	221302	113791	375444	204851

Gene expression in the gut is segmentally regulated, but little is known of the molecular origin of patterning. Analysis of gene expression in colons from mice lacking the methyl-CpG binding repressor MBD2 revealed frequent activation of genes that are normally only expressed in the exocrine pancreas and duodenum. Reduced DNA methylation activated the same gene set in the colon. No significant differences in DNA methylation between the colon and duodenum were detected, but MBD2 was significantly more abundant in the colon. The relevance of MBD2 concentration was tested in a human colon cancer cell line. Depletion of MBD2 was again found to activate exocrine pancreatic genes. Gene activation in this cell culture model was accompanied by loss of promoter-bound MBD2 and increased histone acetylation. The results suggest that modulation of MBD2 during gut development establishes a region-specific gene expression pattern that is essential for establishing correct segmental character.					6035	5645	1056	7032	5968	63036	279

Consistent with these observations, COMMD1 physically associates with HIF-1alpha and inhibits HIF-1alpha stability and HIF-1 transactivation in vitro.

NF-kappaB signaling is implicated as an important regulator of skeletal muscle homeostasis, but the mechanisms by which this transcription factor contributes to muscle maturation and turnover remain unclear. To gain insight into these mechanisms, gene expression profiling was examined in C2C12 myoblasts devoid of NF-kappaB activity. Interestingly, even in proliferating myoblasts, the absence of NF-kappaB caused the pronounced induction of several myofibrillar genes, suggesting that NF-kappaB functions as a negative regulator of late-stage muscle differentiation. Although several myofibrillar promoters contain predicted NF-kappaB binding sites, functional analysis using the troponin-I2 gene as a model revealed that NF-kappaB-mediated repression does not occur through direct DNA binding. In the search for an indirect mediator, the transcriptional repressor YinYang1 (YY1) was identified. While inducers of NF-kappaB stimulated YY1 expression in multiple cell types, genetic ablation of the RelA/p65 subunit of NF-kappaB in both cultured cells and adult skeletal muscle correlated with reduced YY1 transcripts and protein. NF-kappaB regulation of YY1 occurred at the transcriptional level, mediated by direct binding of the p50/p65 heterodimer complex to the YY1 promoter. Furthermore, YY1 was found associated with multiple myofibrillar promoters in C2C12 myoblasts containing NF-kappaB activity. Based on these results, we propose that NF-kappaB regulation of YY1 and transcriptional silencing of myofibrillar genes represent a new mechanism by which NF-kappaB functions in myoblasts to modulate skeletal muscle differentiation.					4619	7134	23616	859	3198	4851	487	1215	55586	8689	4625	5916	1154	7188	4207	7135	1146	3170	8048	840	7138	3693	187	4635	70

LEE_BMP2_TARGETS_UP	M2324		17515606	Lee KY,Jeong JW,Wang J,Ma L,Martin JF,Tsai SY,Lydon JP,DeMayo FJ		Table 2S			Mouse430_2	Arthur Liberzon	Broad Institute	Genes up-regulated in uterus upon knockout of BMP2 [GeneID=650].	The process of implantation, necessary for all viviparous birth, consists of tightly regulated events, including apposition of the blastocyst, attachment to the uterine lumen, and differentiation of the uterine stroma. In rodents and primates the uterine stroma undergoes a process called decidualization. Decidualization, the process by which the uterine endometrial stroma proliferates and differentiates into large epithelioid decidual cells, is critical to the establishment of fetal-maternal communication and the progression of implantation. The role of bone morphogenetic protein 2 (Bmp2) in regulating the transformation of the uterine stroma during embryo implantation in the mouse was investigated by the conditional ablation of Bmp2 in the uterus using the (PR-cre) mouse. Bmp2 gene ablation was confirmed by real-time PCR analysis in the PR-cre; Bmp2fl/fl (termed Bmp2d/d) uterus. While littermate controls average 0.9 litter of 6.2+/-0.7 pups per month, Bmp2d/d females are completely infertile. Analysis of the infertility indicates that whereas embryo attachment is normal in the Bmp2d/d as in control mice, the uterine stroma is incapable of undergoing the decidual reaction to support further embryonic development. Recombinant human BMP2 can partially rescue the decidual response, suggesting that the observed phenotypes are not due to a developmental consequence of Bmp2 ablation. Microarray analysis demonstrates that ablation of Bmp2 leads to specific gene changes, including disruption of the Wnt signaling pathway, Progesterone receptor (PR) signaling, and the induction of prostaglandin synthase 2 (Ptgs2). Taken together, these data demonstrate that Bmp2 is a critical regulator of gene expression and function in the murine uterus.					694	55850	137075	5243	84232	23331	10659	9582	23048	3751	1512	84182	56654	5476	2633	2327	8870	32	5919	4212	9802	9413	1120	1159	6591	4826	929	57139	7113	5295	30061	8313	56912	161291	81618	64753	23466	78989	27013	51181	3489	6356	670	214	54331	160335	58528	113791	8519	55503	4854	1909	55647	144110	65987	94241	56892	117583	284252	196883	3732	10690	29085	1829	155006	5359	3488	3880	2877	25797	1286	54861	5834	9315	57659	5973	10226	780	9687	5239	133746	286467	116835	590	22883	79085	6303	999	4239	2185	10875	10493	133150	85409	10955	10335	112	344875	7881	1593	54795	117248	655	55614	54845	2308	10418	284340	220108	3991	1356	10653	55652	51635	126695	1508	29937	10608	81622	53826	5789	2690	4126	5360	185	168544	367	3709	57161	4882	23452	63874	395	57537	57326	219623	3856	84557	133418	9388	79705	6948	8425	831	5169	56204	1429	2548	3606	89944	128077	55194	55323	6696	51008	25840	23683	3216	23086	147798	2953	10103	57458	7010	64218	3073	65018	4804	54751	4582	51751	22921	199990	25925	78990	10123	26999	1727	150	252995	133584	8510	5575	84693	5618	10018	339229	5121	22999	4237	6567	1606	1628	57507	375775	10406	55607	8848	2309	401236	5549	3691	19	6424	26298	1734	4147	3067	23608	80162	1292	2153	6304	5696	3934	710	54541	7188	65992	3717	182	65990	6542	10218	285440	8625	9242	8654	4256	6387	55664	9806	358	51170	79589	115265	143686	151636	4240	54800	55062	222166	254013	27086	6332	51380	80854	4487	3693	93100	7103	23503	79735	55196	54757	7867	3775	160622	1267	64115	5092	55698	4072	255394	9445	80781	3866	1760	51447	84293	29108	27244	2568	9071	6038	5414	9627	284611	56975	1749	29091	26001	375790	55819	404217	94239	4774	57658	120224	4118	9414	771	25825	115361	5787	84961	28970	272	316	6565	2886	481	57016	100506742	59277	10350	8639	7008	255743	309	27250	10106	8483	1363	5106	121512	4669	2182	10957	477	4057	26523	9910	171024	9882	6768	57419	8153	348	4329	10994	91860	953	10278	25959	4013	3875	137872	586	116039	10267	81888	1992	5168	130132	7041	2517	649	6892	123099	9750	5980	26020	7075	10211	11145	3908	29943	3098	284297	9446	6237	92293	388403	11030	9111	11151	4267	7430	10516	140606	79180	6271	4005	9805	9674	949	84836	10404	7056	28959	4035	1408	153222	255783	155368	5801	10014	7148	54943	54756	5337	3660	56963	83719	58494	1643	4094	80853	6253	79971	84264	55765	2122	23654	57535	166929	8934	4023	2824	1289	2137	347735	23187	25999	64236	9749	132299	80034	2907	79949	1611	8642	3321	7059	115111	55630	50717	29842	169611	4086	6441	282969	55859	81631	51084	760	283131	375035	3482	1294	27034	54587	6415	90427	1519	114907	403313	29989	151887	55748	199692	10451	2217	119587	10628	10742	5654	9975	1201	80263	11152	23710	10964	3667	114569	2952	51655	79140	5027	374569	1153	3625	23551	26471	84952	5164	5351	593	79083	6943	165	92369	8863	64116	64798	27163	1806	221662	57447	79443	26018	221491	3755	28971	1612	5166	1565	3945	6450	6536	288	195827	2152	9807	7138	64840	56649	7450	3005	9185	64073	8804	56997	25891	57185	60685	8854	51560	26084	11170	11274	9915	1365	256302	256691	5998	57211	94274	79812	56265	201163	5872	2896	401494	3725	10205	5890	7227	51676	834	343	160728	50808	9056	22955	5066	130367	10268	473	6817	23623	54836	83787	90203	57484	1396	950	381	349633	23569	9865	23150	5021	22843	9934	9603	9452	5348	56967	284161	729810	92815	339	2982	728392	114792	2687	1509	8722	57111	10158	2650	290	7067	1107	8612	4668	7077	6385	6146	1052	2059	3248	64135	4320	55349	2040	7436	1832	5745	25777	441376	23328	83716	2013	11309	55198	4915	345274	10630	1803	2634	140578	5341	6595	2888	9899	8324	4043	3953	1152	6041	4926	3696	668	29116	92949	491	715	2944	100506144	8503	5327	26751	687	84329	645	126868	24142	56913	83690	1012	55195	26472	26873	23475	8434	8842	901	84632	83988	7704	11098	253827	347	115330	3855	1191	4613	6891	8323	2081	2334	283927	482	5284	3006	159371	84326	11031	5154	9886	1291	144486	55365	26503	726	677	161198	7448	219902	8971	196743	8532	157680	23220	92241	1366	8566	79792	4121	113246	84870	84722	51227	29988	57469	126	10924	10396	4681	113146	6242	4052	94031	4902	7318	146556	5025	2202	269	246	112770	5652	23564	10234	3898	79885	1318	51302	51734	388646	10814	5733	9615	6594	3764	91373	57088	9563	26959	9820	400916	163732	55893	4660	55281	7466	784	3664	793	1805	92370	2052

The process of implantation, necessary for all viviparous birth, consists of tightly regulated events, including apposition of the blastocyst, attachment to the uterine lumen, and differentiation of the uterine stroma. In rodents and primates the uterine stroma undergoes a process called decidualization. Decidualization, the process by which the uterine endometrial stroma proliferates and differentiates into large epithelioid decidual cells, is critical to the establishment of fetal-maternal communication and the progression of implantation. The role of bone morphogenetic protein 2 (Bmp2) in regulating the transformation of the uterine stroma during embryo implantation in the mouse was investigated by the conditional ablation of Bmp2 in the uterus using the (PR-cre) mouse. Bmp2 gene ablation was confirmed by real-time PCR analysis in the PR-cre; Bmp2fl/fl (termed Bmp2d/d) uterus. While littermate controls average 0.9 litter of 6.2+/-0.7 pups per month, Bmp2d/d females are completely infertile. Analysis of the infertility indicates that whereas embryo attachment is normal in the Bmp2d/d as in control mice, the uterine stroma is incapable of undergoing the decidual reaction to support further embryonic development. Recombinant human BMP2 can partially rescue the decidual response, suggesting that the observed phenotypes are not due to a developmental consequence of Bmp2 ablation. Microarray analysis demonstrates that ablation of Bmp2 leads to specific gene changes, including disruption of the Wnt signaling pathway, Progesterone receptor (PR) signaling, and the induction of prostaglandin synthase 2 (Ptgs2). Taken together, these data demonstrate that Bmp2 is a critical regulator of gene expression and function in the murine uterus.					57418	10010	116151	3344	641	51726	10938	7272	79733	10556	11260	5217	9126	908	10713	4144	5965	9926	1407	57213	23165	10513	7374	9134	27316	2107	10468	55740	79174	80007	81875	4351	51249	29028	2288	7873	5471	6741	55035	147111	136	23066	116362	2956	9768	54503	91461	6241	6926	154807	79577	10963	10229	51691	29074	23517	112817	8420	9868	83448	9804	4141	93380	3998	9837	54496	27346	54532	118924	51068	51514	54819	9972	6421	56999	51399	6999	23420	6745	55071	8493	1479	92345	80155	6426	10440	54205	6949	51290	9509	5884	52	201965	203547	4839	9855	58509	51012	22800	4953	5611	153443	3182	22984	2935	6198	10981	1839	151963	7690	1678	6502	23210	9547	1763	55692	221749	51582	56034	1352	4176	3065	57178	5584	50628	1815	6619	57026	10591	6171	51013	84444	10146	4172	204	6624	6343	5110	5427	7398	3720	3313	84154	9464	9818	2237	1163	153339	6059	23034	5226	79707	3840	9816	25902	5793	990	10772	7780	11196	55210	55646	2530	1802	22852	22976	29980	9123	10137	171024	3984	2643	6229	27090	25849	3419	3836	3070	3329	26354	60592	51251	10409	192111	6117	26227	51182	55161	79158	51339	4522	23753	10054	56655	55256	151188	6472	23279	1854	4919	7098	152404	55847	55784	23347	8522	9904	23560	124801	3309	93081	64710	4361	85865	8862	79077	2356	23160	10799	9044	23082	10962	54853	55559	7074	79048	55706	4174	56259	8099	55379	23246	11157	6118	84935	54700	5411	6615	7475	4907	7127	5519	23306	4677	56919	7373	1595	23378	1105	3422	27258	993	79983	51067	5743	10528	85403	113251	6885	699	3949	2243	29128	5198	11177	10575	445	84549	85015	83857	10607	11103	27042	8318	65989	708	10885	26973	2764	9039	262	4927	790	25800	83440	55922	1965	6047	1104	4065	138199	55326	5565	55660	11073	3066	89795	1537	3320	80018	55329	55500	6723	25940	79080	83743	151195	27292	10797	55170	5054	10105	134430	4507	284486	55278	54505	51116	162681	28982	9373	11218	79723	90332	64854	23212	27101	9319	23594	51633	7203	79066	23435	440	57122	132660	7037	25917	7532	4835	23277	8607	1719	79731	25974	25791	53838	51199	286827	55723	7064	5230	85476	25821	705	635	51105	79915	9334	56902	23358	55720	55732	3475	3837	2491	54801	6873	79050	51550	81611	3376	8669	4199	140688	51330	151648	92312	10199	79833	57673	166378	51491	9631	1736	9410	152559	5277	5901	8452	55572	55466	6136	79807	84273	57510	10165	10921	401505	6470	317781	60485	9933	64782	51163	54606	8507	55037	84973	1723	10915	9689	64858	2697	11164	10204	26099	256714	79101	10135	375484	84172	116150	328	9188	8886	80222	27330	6627	51300	3838	51478	5935	7490	51299	142	650	55179	6541	25926	81831	285855	64651	25854	5036	6428	2717	51605	142940	57569	57002	2289	29078	3995	55813	4693	4085	3364	80218	861	5140	57608	10272	253980	10640	79084	84064	5125	79607	169714	5203	5764	10157	169044	79968	54433	10762	26872	9761	1852	84844	9650	10492	3752	54888	10195	81034	84250	5814	2146	5718	56647	9221	6203	1123	23354	11213	5511	55027	11130	231	55127	81542	7027	25894	84879	55759	10212	3308	147007	10940	55178	10635	4678	51602	84946	4686	55172	134492	54962	1266	55661	3267	152519	10926	378708	6790	29098	8458	84135	57019	29979	23450	53371	8974	79647	219699	55651	2961	201626	7422	5723	6573	55299	10514	5442	11137	81621	90121	112950	10694	11062	51750	10808	51634	64425	51575	129401	51651	9425	8208	196951	10294	1737	8061	56888	54931	1786	29896	84916	9688	7262	10785	2043	8891	5631	8894	51096	51728	79441	54069	2706	23367	9100	7372	1583	3099	83879	83480	57486	6921	79646	2618	4891	1964	22868	29967	4092	29968	79959	84524	10969	150223	79023	2873	25945	84908	9093	23171	7707	3397	84417	54973	79596	10920	64859	26	29893	6574	1111	87178	86	168667	285521	5593	114818	23195	8467	81929	10196	9833	9517	144455	5597	79675	63901	3607	4552	84955	25885	10322	22894	7465	55166	123169	28984	6877	10056	57007	55754	54534	1434	23223	81554	4300	400506	5806	2048	59271	9875	5223	4931	4173	3156	6432	285761	6866	140739	2187	6875	55183	26519	23590	4175	6279	64318	9057	58478	84102	2547	5300	4976	63967	10293	9352	9654	26520	27340	122769	10733	10856	51444	3554	55347	10128	10138	55920	84733	11171	4171	388533	6240	1022	471	8899	79944	25929	55153	51095	54663	387893	9521	730249	9759	80219	7371	57478	6832	6713	112970	92106	7915	3276	79902	1633	84901	79691	10598	5888	11340	1635	494115	5049	10465	23076	23169	388753	100287932	79954	116143	54984	7443	54898	25819	81566	58516	6515	3608	51154	27429	131474	1478	55052	55226	9782	51126	2287	221150	80178	11052	79693	415116	54884	27000	284	8128	8880	2960	134218	51278	10197	7296	390	54361	51649	29767	55055	123096	3337	51421	28973	2175	1871	672	3312	116225	9994	6839	3716	5272	2252	60528	79866	9131	9861	11091	55164	3549	57650	1977	9508	25805	4247	5464	6732	5822	1503	56342	23500	25977	11169	23310	51377	84108	7841	2036	9695	4830	5902	6256	253714	1207	1039	84301	63979	387103	167681	57291	55269	257397	9156	10534	5000	688	84823	80856	6996	7514	8038	8520	5887	54475	56945	80031	51026	79366	55388	4809	51018	8833	64848	51053	51450	5711	51260	23203	79830	9277	84034	221830	55125	51388	898	54102	50999	81620	3939	8492	128061	4999	10574	6566	84128	10125	84365	54908	348995	26155	3399	26278	26027	4665

The tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) proteins TSC1 and TSC2 regulate protein translation by inhibiting the serine/threonine kinase mTORC1 (for mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1). However, how TSC1 and TSC2 control overall protein synthesis and the translation of specific mRNAs in response to different mitogenic and nutritional stimuli is largely unknown. We show here that serum withdrawal inhibits mTORC1 signaling, causes disassembly of translation initiation complexes, and causes mRNA redistribution from polysomes to subpolysomes in wild-type mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs). In contrast, these responses are defective in Tsc1(-/-) or Tsc2(-/-) MEFs. Microarray analysis of polysome- and subpolysome-associated mRNAs uncovered specific mRNAs that are translationally regulated by serum, 90% of which are TSC1 and TSC2 dependent. Surprisingly, the mTORC1 inhibitor, rapamycin, abolished mTORC1 activity but only affected approximately 40% of the serum-regulated mRNAs.

Mice lacking the zinc finger transcription factor specificity protein 3 (Sp3) die prenatally in the C57BL/6 background. To elucidate the cause of mortality we analyzed the potential role of Sp3 in embryonic heart development. Sp3 null hearts display defective looping at embryonic day 10.5 (E10.5), and at E14.5 the Sp3 null mutants have developed a range of severe cardiac malformations. In an attempt to position Sp3 in the cardiac developmental hierarchy, we analyzed the expression patterns of >15 marker genes in Sp3 null hearts. Expression of cardiac ankyrin repeat protein (Carp) was downregulated prematurely after E12.5, while expression of the other marker genes was not affected. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis revealed that Sp3 is bound to the Carp promoter region in vivo. Microarray analysis indicates that small-molecule metabolism and cell-cell interactions are the most significantly affected biological processes in E12.5 Sp3 null myocardium. Since the epicardium showed distension from the myocardium, we studied expression of Wt1, a marker for epicardial cells. Wt1 expression was diminished in epicardium-derived cells in the myocardium of Sp3 null hearts. We conclude that Sp3 is required for normal cardiac development and suggest that it has a crucial role in myocardial differentiation.					5408	10732	57761	28992	129831	11144	26471	3676	5055

To elucidate the cause of mortality we analyzed the potential role of Sp3 in embryonic heart development. Sp3 null hearts display defective looping at embryonic day 10.5 (E10.5), and at E14.5 the Sp3 null mutants have developed a range of severe cardiac malformations. In an attempt to position Sp3 in the cardiac developmental hierarchy, we analyzed the expression patterns of >15 marker genes in Sp3 null hearts. Expression of cardiac ankyrin repeat protein (Carp) was downregulated prematurely after E12.5, while expression of the other marker genes was not affected. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis revealed that Sp3 is bound to the Carp promoter region in vivo. Microarray analysis indicates that small-molecule metabolism and cell-cell interactions are the most significantly affected biological processes in E12.5 Sp3 null myocardium. Since the epicardium showed distension from the myocardium, we studied expression of Wt1, a marker for epicardial cells. Wt1 expression was diminished in epicardium-derived cells in the myocardium of Sp3 null hearts. We conclude that Sp3 is required for normal cardiac development and suggest that it has a crucial role in myocardial differentiation.					4833	9465	283375	2155	10637	10158	10244	130340	3732	284106	6941	5025	51733	2123	7366	11202	1036	10491	9600	8807	10227	6866	6670	114112	3856	8536	23464	2184	1774	10290	26471	5199	115024	8847	7365	5269	83877	9936	229	3958	100	2169	2790	149465	6050	64757	54474	713	5641	7172	23604	2882	10437	5163	10799	2745	10040	200879	4615	3957	922	4128	116447	79777	10114	10588	150223	23475	358	112464	2219	8685	1962	51635	120406	130814	151556	51201	51170	3795	282969	22949	3655	8986	2121	307	706	10901	1512

The infant leukemia-associated gene Ott1 (Rbm15) has broad regulatory effects within murine hematopoiesis. However, germ line Ott1 deletion results in fetal demise prior to embryonic day 10.5, indicating additional developmental requirements for Ott1. The spen gene family, to which Ott1 belongs, has a transcriptional activation/repression domain and RNA recognition motifs and has a significant role in the development of the head and thorax in Drosophila melanogaster. Early Ott1-deficient embryos show growth retardation and incomplete closure of the notochord. Further analysis demonstrated placental defects in the spongiotrophoblast and syncytiotrophoblast layers, resulting in an arrest of vascular branching morphogenesis. The rescue of the placental defect using a conditional allele with a trophoblast-sparing cre transgene allowed embryos to form a normal placenta and survive gestation. This outcome showed that the process of vascular branching morphogenesis in Ott1-deficient animals was regulated by the trophoblast compartment rather than the fetal vasculature. Mice surviving to term manifested hyposplenia and abnormal cardiac development. Analysis of global gene expression of Ott1-deficient embryonic hearts showed an enrichment of hypoxia-related genes and a significant alteration of several candidate genes critical for cardiac development. Thus, Ott1-dependent pathways, in addition to being implicated in leukemogenesis, may also be important for the pathogenesis of placental insufficiency and cardiac malformations.					1871	6664	23493	3091	54584	7490	5087	93	10370

The mouse aldehyde oxidase AOH2 (aldehyde oxidase homolog 2) is a molybdoflavoenzyme. Harderian glands are the richest source of AOH2, although the protein is detectable also in sebaceous glands, epidermis, and other keratinized epithelia. The levels of AOH2 in the Harderian gland and skin are controlled by genetic background, being maximal in CD1 and C57BL/6 and minimal in DBA/2, CBA, and 129/Sv strains. Testosterone is a negative regulator of AOH2 in Harderian glands. Purified AOH2 oxidizes retinaldehyde into retinoic acid, while it is devoid of pyridoxal-oxidizing activity. Aoh2(-/-) mice, the first aldehyde oxidase knockout animals ever generated, are viable and fertile. The data obtained for this knockout model indicate a significant role of AOH2 in the local synthesis and biodisposition of endogenous retinoids in the Harderian gland and skin. The Harderian gland's transcriptome of knockout mice demonstrates overall downregulation of direct retinoid-dependent genes as well as perturbations in pathways controlling lipid homeostasis and cellular secretion, particularly in sexually immature animals. The skin of knockout mice is characterized by thickening of the epidermis in basal conditions and after UV light exposure. This has correlates in the corresponding transcriptome, which shows enrichment and overall upregulation of genes involved in hypertrophic responses.					81567	5894	8879	1050	22853	2768	81609	4253	8682	55654	7109	84804	79903	6047	5066	7335	4905	84557	130340	92105	23313	5830	9267	57217	91445	23305	81846	2799

Inadequate remyelination of brain white matter lesions has been associated with a failure of oligodendrocyte precursors to differentiate into mature, myelin-producing cells. In order to better understand which genes play a critical role in oligodendrocyte differentiation, we performed time-dependent, genome-wide gene expression studies of mouse Oli-neu cells as they differentiate into process-forming and myelin basic protein-producing cells, following treatment with three different agents. Our data indicate that different inducers activate distinct pathways that ultimately converge into the completely differentiated state, where regulated gene sets overlap maximally. In order to also gain insight into the functional role of genes that are regulated in this process, we silenced 88 of these genes using small interfering RNA and identified multiple repressors of spontaneous differentiation of Oli-neu, most of which were confirmed in rat primary oligodendrocyte precursors cells. Among these repressors were CNP, a well-known myelin constituent, and three phosphatases, each known to negatively control mitogen-activated protein kinase cascades. We show that a novel inhibitor for one of the identified genes, dual-specificity phosphatase DUSP10/MKP5, was also capable of inducing oligodendrocyte differentiation in primary oligodendrocyte precursors. Oligodendrocytic differentiation feedback loops may therefore yield pharmacological targets to treat disease related to dysfunctional myelin deposition.					55055	91057	55164	51155	5933	23397	51377	65117	283431	55320	6678	9837	1786	9319	3835	55771	205251	10024	4208	63901	26284	259266	983	63979	1466	3161	27042	51659	1468	3945	2177	57122	7153	3014	27092	10615	1104	55706	84524	4605	79071	29089	5347	1462	1854	55646	10238	4176	9229	412	5425	56942	6877	896	145553	23306	22856	7013	22949	55536	1063	7227	5270	10733	8812	83463	112479	5888	4796	90417	6241	2261	57405	210	10592	84722	7514	7431	80119	9232	24137	10112	23225	4678	54542	80321	54865	11167	284403	83746	5427	11065	5557	348995	5036	6470	55038	6553	2065	401541	9733	2596	9761	23076	9700	197335	55732	51203	1029	7407	5984	133522	83986	79073	64710	27330	7515	3619	1017	54821	54991	55172	79723	8317	8086	55746	90381	7465	340719	359845	9782	221150	54801	4174	30834	29028	26271	10293	26155	4085	150468	79441	1111	5982	9788	157570	57559	4172	6117	54069	55839	1163	29781	4175	7290	29127	23223	54997	85409	4953	7221	10572	54962	63922	4133	55355	4254	55166	9918	23266	54908	3015	6839	10273	55183	9786	83461	11004	9787	170961	9768	253714	286827	9824	64105	11113	55010	79968	890	1736	8971	113115	282809	1058	9055	7102	54475	55165	8148	23066	1635	79892	4691	26608	55125	343099	8458	80142	5325	219844	9590	57650	4288	7866	7272	51015	29128	22974	701	51514	2237	146956	22995	6723	332	128239	5985	3397	10403	54478	55215	9759	6949	348235	25936	3148	64782	891	23294	144455	6240	84904	84515	54492	7884	23649	2175	83891	2305	57461	5777	8914	55789	4001	301	79801	4751	81610	11218	51026	92370	280636	9221	25804	4171	11169	2956	9663	83541	146909	8318	157313	10051	254531	63967	4781	1192	80169	9133	10111	84913	699	7468	51634	23354	55137	7398	79019	3925	84823	5820	4602	64943	79366	201725	55143	5764	8438	10460	23022	9124	3984	122769	4361	10635	8655	302	6118	144402	4603	84314	1719	3832	2491	23452	79902	5252	79856	11243	151246	83604	81620	64151	5050	9735	118980	57673	3978	57326	51149	619279	22929	9401	378938	5426	23024	6886	55872	991	51567	7298	8745	10763	9493	220134	79833	83743	80028	126917	22881	10714	1033	2012	5983	8487	25929	57211	3927	54892	126133	11266	51177	6542	3716	283643	9585	84080	10082	3070	195828	81577	55329	22998	6874	78995	4998	9156	56256	9586	1763	10274	29893	81552	2146	9212	349149	25939	56852	79682	7378	6941	1062	6790	28984	7443	79866	5527	5422	22994	55723	990	23380	91687	7168	8479	5558	163786	26147	7372	51053	7516	9656	5905	3613	2335	81930	3690	26586	5430	51602	1663	4173	23234	91010	1164	10276	729533	64853	3177	84331	79077	26986	5395	10926	113130	200734	23658	286128	84902	79960	23178	6507	79000	389792	57407	8379	79023	9654	641	51375	10465	1870	55367	27164	81611	57819	666	8520	132660	5178	54465	60436	23211	7536	23590	201299	93323	7083	83903	84318	9088	79915	5074	83540	132001	836	147841	995	2201	7003	645	899	8241	23576	83879	5612	79102	6275	11339	675	5928	64946	27293	27346	7374	3480	1869	55915	53635	26010	115106	54930	387893	11340	126549	2842	80152	3949	115708	80178	9793	93081	1894	220042	840	51776	154791	93594	9833	79075	387103	3201	994	5424	3149	80005	151648	6608	55509	898	3838	5420	55686	56603	10105	51574	60314	9262	126393	6491	51496	729440	84986	84083	53371	93663	444	1031	84250	55388	378708	2794	8549	3433	8208	9134	6502	6093	221527	79728	874	84310	84888	29087	642938	51512	55635	286826	11200	26031

In order to better understand which genes play a critical role in oligodendrocyte differentiation, we performed time-dependent, genome-wide gene expression studies of mouse Oli-neu cells as they differentiate into process-forming and myelin basic protein-producing cells, following treatment with three different agents. Our data indicate that different inducers activate distinct pathways that ultimately converge into the completely differentiated state, where regulated gene sets overlap maximally. In order to also gain insight into the functional role of genes that are regulated in this process, we silenced 88 of these genes using small interfering RNA and identified multiple repressors of spontaneous differentiation of Oli-neu, most of which were confirmed in rat primary oligodendrocyte precursors cells. Among these repressors were CNP, a well-known myelin constituent, and three phosphatases, each known to negatively control mitogen-activated protein kinase cascades. We show that a novel inhibitor for one of the identified genes, dual-specificity phosphatase DUSP10/MKP5, was also capable of inducing oligodendrocyte differentiation in primary oligodendrocyte precursors. Oligodendrocytic differentiation feedback loops may therefore yield pharmacological targets to treat disease related to dysfunctional myelin deposition.					262	388650	51773	57162	163033	399665	83982	55204	7586	10519	55125	23187	79683	51062	7043	4902	4851	10580	83596	25915	26012	41	121260	8502	23462	55011	79837	899	9926	10184	957	5588	1410	4897	5058	4645	84895	55861	2861	9334	140707	84131	8434	64236	25797	257194	23301	29994	9145	26137	94015	92815	114134	23208	4638	55793	6526	9306	59345	8905	3006	130574	6990	9456	162239	6505	339451	56994	84272	64077	9321	6382	3998	3140	9444	11221	25855	6934	54532	84649	7840	25980	8537	80256	151742	84056	149603	79993	55558	7351	23677	7174	5998	54828	1627	57590	120	6772	389072	10095	6884	6938	51278	214	388341	23545	118813	5274	663	4601	4135	55269	817	9026	55347	221035	55092	3742	4983	9839	2045	84553	138639	4131	320	5538	51115	57142	283659	55573	23381	321	5575	253260	4300	10396	5118	9911	5791	29951	6253	378938	4155	23446	23321	51148	94031	66000	578	163404	51090	23307	54566	25900	56852	7942	10957	3400	23400	54149	23288	1291	126961	9931	79934	1837	534	9910	23271	2888	5911	79929	11343	221	4646	93986	55704	83439	56623	5168	64798	8153	9194	23150	1263	6909	2664	9019	57535	2819	28996	220965	89795	1301	57653	55251	7468	6515	401152	26061	1826	9649	22933	64781	25814	84102	6303	29088	79585	89796	81605	7763	22873	10527	9900	55605	60312	79956	4082	23523	7837	84206	11127	54790	51259	78999	8879	9706	11138	79570	23097	8997	84457	2353	2549	64376	154141	30812	2067	55909	672	55152	2036	145553	7572	65989	10055	6405	25849	84662	143686	5730	7741	9776	59338	23114	2059	10181	121053	57154	694	1374	57526	2743	4125	157313	6711	8419	6676	23327	51663	28978	2014	3636	4248	57458	8503	11188	6857	3696	57608	1994	219699	90933	84669	283174	51631	8455	1107	92737	1292	23241	7301	1287	10392	5627	4147	84455	6646	23603	51175	23770	283232	482	150946	2764	4616	132864	9564	27158	26270	6507	7162	55062	8945	6659	1789	667	1849	10449	220382	22979	3732	55610	83700	6498	1836	205428	132720	26999	10014	27253	5621	2317	125058	827	57498	2217	63917	755	2932	55750	10507	284297	10765	463	401548	26502	80821	9351	79982	7013	23705	1022	10900	5576	54664	258010	411	57409	80176	158293	51192	80975	9267	91452	8933	84446	59353	9732	400673	23671	23557	2140	5654	288	7077	57407	8473	9491	91703	23608	25782	7145	90102	84930	55664	337872	12	55773	25914	55248	2187	643965	4038	23768	11060	26052	7267	6860	6801	79158	784	6882	10236	85301	196394	9665	55679	57613	91614	57670	4793	27242	83988	1788	56061	23243	3957	7328	3929	23383	3736	2803	163786	5339	51754	10522	85407	51571	23492	781	114790	10982	10397	467	58517	391002	26576	1990	51150	5152	84720	4217	85440	901	3709	2581	128989	11011	57561	5142	5578	54674	9185	29896	6271	115353	51088	11264	1809	158747	10087	153020	51	53349	55603	4660	55266	9679	5063	345611	169792	975	23328	8408	134353	3983	7263	83719	26292	64792	25943	117584	11166	6533	1540	78987	54863	10100	25901	9625	928	221079	8932	394	55914	6595	9517	22891	129285	57210	23392	3167	51201	149345	51616	51421	57348	26010	9416	22919	7368	79971	377007	51763	5048	4756	90634	28971	157285	256987	150678	5354	10026	950	5649	114907	9507	92400	89866	23621	9201	6041	146050	11142	10066	162427	5520	1267	9413	9315	2037	54914	153222	139886	10150	4815	144165	6443	51302	3064	79789	26524	165	10628	79969	460	25941	4045	7204	4094	64005	23254	347689	84230	53344	23302	5365	1368	55103	9712	115817	23348	3725	26229	5271	8863	8349	23345	6653	1468	6565	374659	590	57539	27130	90799	22841	27131	118429	11258	85352	125488	9388	4782	9975	84959	54585	92335	10382	65983	93058	23093	5937	84460	115201	9772	140710	11076	57185	1528	10868	56995	2263	94239	100505381	221981	112885	221184	145508	387263	57175	85458	11183	9770	403313	6285	8744	254263	5993	80303	3304	1638	2788	1601	4595	84978	55317	4358	63971	83444	114793	387103	5364	721	1073	1902	63027	349149	54799	57555	79152	10575	10220	135114	55652	11080	389941	5099	54872	7745	391	57636	26090	1463	113791	5414	84263	8722	80139	130132	140688	83473	80862	84890	154043	5154	89927	4204	414918	23443	201562	152503	5521	5144	26266	11235	10039	55780	94241	2895	55198	57642	5163	57132	738	6814	9725	57689	54437	29071	151963	9711	150094	4791	255520	22902	9813	283248	79178	115557	1573	84270	23632	56123	53834	64785	2775	1288	79733	9464	93611	23300	51322	7430	129303	79603	400451	80856	30818	116138	10137	126321	84326	64756	255394	9957	4355	23258	6461	84193	64114	5930	8629	55287	51661	92521	143458	10577	283450	25927	745	29942	1200	286826	9091	57552	780	10006	3717	2072	9611	338811	26224	2675	58497	58476	115	900	1124	9851	22924	51805	7290	23613	23189	80325	10124	7078	1606	171586	23483	64224	5465	649	1513	1008	4351	113675	3032	9021	85016	7403	80031	10174	6988	54463	57658	3965	4137	54918	92667	201895	91875	203	127002	22839	9514	65055	1297	558	23401	9781	1108	55765	80206	85459	22858	9110	10186	65065	65018	8936	3797	64776	54839	1318	128853	79905	112483	79625	5797	2891	79867	3037	9786	8029	89797	7130	22807	26953	150737	56776	81631	443	56252	1995	10290	63894	5217	10078	2840	1302	57553	2534	4139	4668	84898	137492	3182	51621	80725	386618	143872	399687	148170	55754	79817	401251	388419	256472	26018	84552	59084	40

Inadequate remyelination of brain white matter lesions has been associated with a failure of oligodendrocyte precursors to differentiate into mature, myelin-producing cells. In order to better understand which genes play a critical role in oligodendrocyte differentiation, we performed time-dependent, genome-wide gene expression studies of mouse Oli-neu cells as they differentiate into process-forming and myelin basic protein-producing cells, following treatment with three different agents. Our data indicate that different inducers activate distinct pathways that ultimately converge into the completely differentiated state, where regulated gene sets overlap maximally. In order to also gain insight into the functional role of genes that are regulated in this process, we silenced 88 of these genes using small interfering RNA and identified multiple repressors of spontaneous differentiation of Oli-neu, most of which were confirmed in rat primary oligodendrocyte precursors cells. Among these repressors were CNP, a well-known myelin constituent, and three phosphatases, each known to negatively control mitogen-activated protein kinase cascades. We show that a novel inhibitor for one of the identified genes, dual-specificity phosphatase DUSP10/MKP5, was also capable of inducing oligodendrocyte differentiation in primary oligodendrocyte precursors. Oligodendrocytic differentiation feedback loops may therefore yield pharmacological targets to treat disease related to dysfunctional myelin deposition.					26502	57453	9481	9844	4155	84932	3570	7368	9053	22881	9641	5997	10580	85458	7135	64376	3371	1021	2131	1869	57633	81490	54828	8455	57144	6887	7586	900	8650	254065	4978	3736	5063	94241	10397	51763	26959	11342	18	19

Calcium signaling is a central regulator of cardiomyocyte growth and function. Calmodulin is a critical mediator of calcium signals. Because the amount of calmodulin within cardiomyocytes is limiting, the precise control of calmodulin expression is important for the regulation of calcium signaling. In this study, we show for the first time that calmodulin levels are regulated posttranscriptionally in heart failure. The cardiomyocyte-restricted microRNA miR-1 inhibited the translation of calmodulin-encoding mRNAs via highly conserved target sites within their 3' untranslated regions. In keeping with its effect on calmodulin expression, miR-1 downregulated calcium-calmodulin signaling through calcineurin to NFAT. miR-1 also negatively regulated the expression of Mef2a and Gata4, key transcription factors that mediate calcium-dependent changes in gene expression.

We previously observed that nitric oxide (NO) exposure increases the stability of mRNAs encoding heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) and TIEG-1 in human and mouse fibroblasts. Here, we have used microarrays to look broadly for changes in mRNA stability in response to NO treatment. Using human IMR-90 and mouse NIH 3T3 fibroblasts treated with actinomycin D to block de novo transcription, microarray analysis suggested that the stability of the majority of mRNAs was unaffected. Among the mRNAs that were stabilized by NO treatment, seven transcripts were found in both IMR-90 and NIH 3T3 cells (CHIC2, GADD45B, HO-1, PTGS2, RGS2, TIEG, and ID3) and were chosen for further analysis. All seven mRNAs showed at least one hit of a signature motif for the stabilizing RNA-binding protein (RBP) HuR; accordingly, ribonucleoprotein immunoprecipitation analysis revealed that all seven mRNAs associated with HuR. In keeping with a functional role of HuR in the response to NO, a measurable fraction of HuR increased in the cytoplasm following NO treatment. However, among the seven transcripts, only HO-1 mRNA showed a robust increase in the level of its association with HuR following NO treatment. In turn, HO-1 mRNA and protein levels were significantly reduced when HuR levels were silenced in IMR-90 cells, and they were elevated when HuR was overexpressed. In sum, our results indicate that NO stabilizes mRNA subsets in fibroblasts, identify HuR as an RBP implicated in the NO response, reveal that HuR alone is insufficient for stabilizing several mRNAs by NO, and show that HO-1 induction by NO is regulated by HuR.					5997	4616	26511	3162	5743	3399	7071

Cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase (POR) is the obligate electron donor for all microsomal cytochrome P450 enzymes, which catalyze the metabolism of a wide spectrum of xenobiotic and endobiotic compounds. Point mutations in POR have been found recently in patients with Antley-Bixler-like syndrome, which includes limb skeletal defects. In order to study P450 function during limb and skeletal development, we deleted POR specifically in mouse limb bud mesenchyme. Forelimbs and hind limbs in conditional knockout (CKO) mice were short with thin skeletal elements and fused joints. POR deletion occurred earlier in forelimbs than in hind limbs, leading additionally to soft tissue syndactyly and loss of wrist elements and phalanges due to changes in growth, cell death, and skeletal segmentation. Transcriptional analysis of E12.5 mouse forelimb buds demonstrated the expression of P450s involved in retinoic acid, cholesterol, and arachidonic acid metabolism. Biochemical analysis of CKO limbs confirmed retinoic acid excess. In CKO limbs, expression of genes throughout the whole cholesterol biosynthetic pathway was upregulated, and cholesterol deficiency can explain most aspects of the phenotype. Thus, cellular POR-dependent cholesterol synthesis is essential during limb and skeletal development. Modulation of P450 activity could contribute to susceptibility of the embryo and developing organs to teratogenesis.					2224	132949	2222	39	3638	7108	6713	1595	50814	1717	2267	47	134429	4597	6309	79071	3949	6721	79698	4598	2296	4047	3157	1592	6307	3422

HuR is an RNA-binding protein implicated in a diverse array of pathophysiological processes due to its effects on the posttranscriptional regulation of AU- and U-rich mRNAs. Here we reveal HuR's requirement in embryonic development through its genetic ablation. Obligatory HuR-null embryos exhibited a stage retardation phenotype and failed to survive beyond midgestation. By means of conditional transgenesis, we restricted HuR's mutation in either embryonic or endothelial compartments to demonstrate that embryonic lethality is consequent to defects in extraembryonic placenta. HuR's absence impaired the invagination of allantoic capillaries into the chorionic trophoblast layer and the differentiation of syncytiotrophoblast cells that control the morphogenesis and vascularization of the placental labyrinth and fetal support. HuR-null embryos rescued from these placental defects proceeded to subsequent developmental stages but displayed defects in skeletal ossification, fusions in limb elements, and asplenia. By coupling gene expression measurements, data meta-analysis, and HuR-RNA association assays, we identified transcription and growth factor mRNAs controlled by HuR, primarily at the posttranscriptional level, to guide morphogenesis, specification, and patterning.

Accumulating evidence suggests that regulation of RNA processing through an RNP-driven mechanism is important for coordinated gene expression. This hypothesis predicts that defects in RNP biogenesis will adversely affect the elaboration of specific gene expression programs. To explore the role of RNP biogenesis on mammalian development, we have characterized the phenotype of mice hypomorphic for Thoc1. Thoc1 encodes an essential component of the evolutionarily conserved TREX complex. TREX accompanies the elongating RNA polymerase II and facilitates RNP assembly and recruitment of RNA processing factors. Hypomorphic Thoc1 mice are viable despite significantly reduced Thoc1 expression in the tissues examined. While most tissues of Thoc1-deficient mice appear to develop and function normally, gametogenesis is severely compromised. Male infertility is associated with a loss in spermatocyte viability and abnormal endocrine signaling. We suggest that loss of spermatocyte viability is a consequence of defects in the expression of genes required for normal differentiation of cell types within the testes.

Accumulating evidence suggests that regulation of RNA processing through an RNP-driven mechanism is important for coordinated gene expression. This hypothesis predicts that defects in RNP biogenesis will adversely affect the elaboration of specific gene expression programs. To explore the role of RNP biogenesis on mammalian development, we have characterized the phenotype of mice hypomorphic for Thoc1. Thoc1 encodes an essential component of the evolutionarily conserved TREX complex. TREX accompanies the elongating RNA polymerase II and facilitates RNP assembly and recruitment of RNA processing factors. Hypomorphic Thoc1 mice are viable despite significantly reduced Thoc1 expression in the tissues examined. While most tissues of Thoc1-deficient mice appear to develop and function normally, gametogenesis is severely compromised. Male infertility is associated with a loss in spermatocyte viability and abnormal endocrine signaling. We suggest that loss of spermatocyte viability is a consequence of defects in the expression of genes required for normal differentiation of cell types within the testes. A number of the genes affected appear to be direct targets for regulation by Thoc1. These findings support the notion that Thoc1-mediated RNP assembly contributes to the coordinated expression of genes necessary for normal differentiation and development in vivo.					2623	6662	1191	2516	5538	7490	1514	3625	4851	2668	2626	5010	269	190	50846	4103	30812	3815	9633	7421

Spi-1 and Fli-1 are ETS transcription factors recurrently deregulated in mouse erythroleukemia induced by Friend viruses. Since they share the same core DNA binding site, we investigated whether they may contribute to erythroleukemia by common mechanisms. Using inducible knockdown, we demonstrated that Fli-1 contributes to proliferation, survival, and differentiation arrest of erythroleukemic cells harboring an activated fli-1 locus. Similarly, we used inducible Fli-1 knockdown and either hexamethylenebisacetamide (HMBA)- or small interfering RNA-mediated Spi-1 knockdown to investigate their respective contributions in erythroleukemic cells harboring an activated spi-1 locus. In these cells, simple or double knockdown of both Spi-1 and Fli-1 additively contributed to induce proliferation arrest and differentiation. Transcriptome profiling revealed that virtually all transcripts affected by both Fli-1 knockdown and HMBA are affected in an additive manner. Among these additively downregulated transcripts, more than 20% encode proteins involved in ribosome biogenesis, and conserved ETS binding sites are present in their gene promoters. Through chromatin immunoprecipitation, we demonstrated the association of Spi-1 and Fli-1 on these promoters in Friend erythroleukemic cells. These data lead us to propose that the oncogenicity of Spi-1, Fli-1, and possibly other ETS transcription factors may involve their ability to stimulate ribosome biogenesis.					55831	118	37	10745	90624	84641	1045	9779	54965	10762	140609	10598	7874	10965	152503	27333	25901	55209	4637	11180	253635	10181	3039	9217	546	80169	115330	55905	64215	84926	23559	9246	10254	84976	375346	124446	26984	9101	10200	29926	9921	51406	64754	7203	7832	145748	83638	64150	7716	2512	79961	64395	1211	400	84909	1608	7351	94056	11059	50937	63979	80135	8828	4733	2530	8528	51734	89796	317662	91752	6499	1294	27243	3920	29959	8237	54458	57228	120	55269	23253	50626	4215	115992	212	3792	2145	2235	9820	6517	2896	6714	9975	55810	8751	23112	57804	54839	28996	7737	84152	10906	23053	1774	2872	2919	8178	9911	4345	5130	166	5792	8848	8370	57634

Heterozygous HNF1A mutations cause pancreatic-islet beta-cell dysfunction and monogenic diabetes (MODY3).

Dppa4 (developmental pluripotency-associated 4) has been identified in several high-profile screens as a gene that is expressed exclusively in pluripotent cells. It encodes a nuclear protein with an SAP-like domain and appears to be associated preferentially with transcriptionally active chromatin. Its exquisite expression pattern and results of RNA interference experiments have led to speculation that Dppa4, as well as its nearby homolog Dppa2, might play essential roles in embryonic stem (ES) cell function and/or germ cell development. To rigorously assess suggested roles, we have generated Dppa4-deficient and Dppa4/Dppa2 doubly deficient ES cells, as well as mice lacking Dppa4. Contrary to predictions, we find that Dppa4 is completely dispensable for ES cell identity and germ cell development. Instead, loss of Dppa4 in mice results in late embryonic/perinatal death and striking skeletal defects with partial penetrance. Thus, surprisingly, Dppa4-deficiency affects tissues that apparently never transcribed the gene, and at least some loss-of-function defects manifest phenotypically at an embryonic stage long after physiologic Dppa4 expression has ceased. Concomitant with targeted gene inactivation, we have introduced into the Dppa4 locus a red fluorescent marker (tandem-dimer red fluorescent protein) that is compatible with green fluorescent proteins and allows noninvasive visualization of pluripotent cells and reprogramming events.					9829	55015	283677	84944	4760	90293	84779	441376	55743	2877	56163	6795	2735	84223	4225	54937	132954	4744	133619	284106	7010	57480	84072	56164	360163	5243	51361	126669	2571	3055	7274	6690	762	246777	54922	121355	54514	794	4542	83447	55211	9892	93426	1618	7278	130340
KOHOUTEK_CCNT1_TARGETS	M2401		19364821	Kohoutek J,Li Q,Blazek D,Luo Z,Jiang H,Peterlin BM		Table 1S: CycT1 siRNA			MOUSE_GENE_SYMBOL	Arthur Liberzon	Broad Institute	Genes down-regulated in E14 ES (embryonic stem) cells upon knockdown of CYCT1 [GeneID=904] by RNAi.	The positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb) is essential for the elongation of transcription and cotranscriptional processing by RNA polymerase II. In mammals, it contains predominantly the C-type cyclin cyclin T1 (CycT1) or CycT2 and cyclin-dependent kinase 9 (Cdk9). To determine if these cyclins have redundant functions or affect distinct sets of genes, we genetically inactivated the CycT2 gene (Ccnt2) using the beta-galactosidase-neomycin gene (beta-geo) gene trap technology in the mouse. Visualizing beta-galactosidase during mouse embryogenesis revealed that CycT2 is expressed abundantly during embryogenesis and throughout the organism in the adult. This finding was reflected in the expression of CycT2 in all adult tissues and organs. However, despite numerous matings of heterozygous mice, we observed no CycT2(-/-) embryos, pups, or adult mice. This early lethality could have resulted from decreased expression of critical genes, which were revealed by short interfering RNAs against CycT2 in embryonic stem cells. Thus, CycT1 and CycT2 are not redundant, and these different P-TEFb complexes regulate subsets of distinct genes that are important for embryonic development.					6926	1410	50861	221749	1364	6284	8878	9317	308	2877	64129	2274	1294	5627	6271	3861	1212	130589	92737	1140	5654	58191	84419	360	9961	84836	4070	399665	11152	55630	583	59084	400629	649	80270	3875	37	904	1201	197135	826	727957	10123	113146	968	5225	2810	3691	128439	55212

Control of cell differentiation occurs through transcriptional mechanisms and through epigenetic modification. Using a chromatin immunoprecipitation-on-chip approach, we performed a genome-wide search for target genes of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR gamma) and its partner protein retinoid X receptor alpha during adipogenesis. We show that these two receptors target several genes that encode histone lysine methyltransferase SET domain proteins. The histone H4 Lys 20 (H4K20) monomethyltransferase PR-Set7/Setd8 gene is upregulated by PPAR gamma during adipogenesis, and the knockdown of PR-Set7/Setd8 suppressed adipogenesis. Intriguingly, monomethylated H4K20 (H4K20me1) levels are robustly increased toward the end of differentiation. PR-Set7/Setd8 positively regulates the expression of PPAR gamma and its targets through H4K20 monomethylation. Furthermore, the activation of PPAR gamma transcriptional activity leads to the induction of H4K20me1 modification of PPAR gamma and its targets and thereby promotes adipogenesis. We also show that PPAR gamma targets PPAR gamma2 and promotes its gene expression through H4K20 monomethylation. Our results connect transcriptional regulation and epigenetic chromatin modulation through H4K20 monomethylation during adipogenesis through a feedback loop.					1990	5094	91408	54985	5624	51108	343099	950	80194	161829	3991	55269	6623	10449	8079	2595	3200	84231	4054	10162	79812	51283	57458	9924	10628	55355	100134934	5346	11261	83759	415116	11259	200205	79228	2931	4811	51060	64327	841	23019	10267	3601	145482	9632	8462	2184	2110	96459	3417	11264	128486	1622	23076	1455	54600	3201	157567	7786	55231	375686	341405	23237	255520	55788	253724	6453	868	1742	83445	130355	3198	10395	23786	84173	51727	30	57621	4615	80218	378	84263	10261	1891	2109	55508	9946	80273	131118	84919	80790	5001	51805	83450	10957	79027	7178	57804	51	9943	4023	9869	146691	37	6483	7536	84319	55593	1666	7184	23078	201626	1374	23659	54578	8082	7351	7431	51650	55589	79778	256302	374877	10609	35	9600	7532	116085	25963	51236	10455	112970	5054	200186	6895	92960	4257	2053	79691	10994	523	5089	60681	27106	34	825	441168	257194	50999	1376	64223	2108	2771

Control of cell differentiation occurs through transcriptional mechanisms and through epigenetic modification. Using a chromatin immunoprecipitation-on-chip approach, we performed a genome-wide search for target genes of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR gamma) and its partner protein retinoid X receptor alpha during adipogenesis. We show that these two receptors target several genes that encode histone lysine methyltransferase SET domain proteins. The histone H4 Lys 20 (H4K20) monomethyltransferase PR-Set7/Setd8 gene is upregulated by PPAR gamma during adipogenesis, and the knockdown of PR-Set7/Setd8 suppressed adipogenesis. Intriguingly, monomethylated H4K20 (H4K20me1) levels are robustly increased toward the end of differentiation. PR-Set7/Setd8 positively regulates the expression of PPAR gamma and its targets through H4K20 monomethylation. Furthermore, the activation of PPAR gamma transcriptional activity leads to the induction of H4K20me1 modification of PPAR gamma and its targets and thereby promotes adipogenesis. We also show that PPAR gamma targets PPAR gamma2 and promotes its gene expression through H4K20 monomethylation.

Control of cell differentiation occurs through transcriptional mechanisms and through epigenetic modification. Using a chromatin immunoprecipitation-on-chip approach, we performed a genome-wide search for target genes of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR gamma) and its partner protein retinoid X receptor alpha during adipogenesis. We show that these two receptors target several genes that encode histone lysine methyltransferase SET domain proteins. The histone H4 Lys 20 (H4K20) monomethyltransferase PR-Set7/Setd8 gene is upregulated by PPAR gamma during adipogenesis, and the knockdown of PR-Set7/Setd8 suppressed adipogenesis. Intriguingly, monomethylated H4K20 (H4K20me1) levels are robustly increased toward the end of differentiation. PR-Set7/Setd8 positively regulates the expression of PPAR gamma and its targets through H4K20 monomethylation. Furthermore, the activation of PPAR gamma transcriptional activity leads to the induction of H4K20me1 modification of PPAR gamma and its targets and thereby promotes adipogenesis. We also show that PPAR gamma targets PPAR gamma2 and promotes its gene expression through H4K20 monomethylation. Our results connect transcriptional regulation and epigenetic chromatin modulation through H4K20 monomethylation during adipogenesis through a feedback loop.					10257	5468	130814	79602	84263	23788	116254	83606	10144	4836	23236	116236	8844	150962	79603	28999	54927	483	51283	9370	4686	55144	3033	10010	11176	58506	1822	55486	6307	8079	54812	6272	8850	57136	7517	153090	2872	210	79646	9908	387893	5621	4329	56204	94103	56994	26269	4338	51222	5860	11112	399665	85465	9415	91137	2230	84522	23786	3991	5830	4726	6510	27069	2167	51571	23005	51646	415116	587	10989	8694	79666	83752	10961	51380	84696	8412	9572	2109	5091	55161	8672	56997	11264	57509	5211	64410	2181	26275	64781	9936	128338	23167	3459	3417	57458	25874	91750	51704	2653	94015	10449	950	4054	8504	23659	60673	1176	51025	5351	4779	522	51	22821	5095	34	5495	145482	2040	10766	4023	8398	51144	94081	11145	51449	518	64859	57104	2101	81792	1431	9267	6414	22849	11261	316	5207	55787	7905	10555	124801	115704	256302	55652

Stimulation of osteoblast differentiation from mesenchymal stem cells is a potential strategy for bone repair. Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) that induce osteoblastic differentiation have been successfully used in humans to treat fractures. Here we outline a new approach to the stimulation of osteoblast differentiation using small molecules that stimulate BMP activity. We have identified the amiloride derivative phenamil as a stimulator of osteoblast differentiation and mineralization. Remarkably, phenamil acts cooperatively with BMPs to induce the expression of BMP target genes, osteogenic markers, and matrix mineralization in both mesenchymal stem cell lines and calvarial organ cultures. Transcriptional profiling of cells treated with phenamil led to the identification of tribbles homolog 3 (Trb3) as a mediator of its effects. Trb3 is induced by phenamil selectively in cells with osteoblastic potential. Both Trb3 and phenamil stabilize the expression of SMAD, the critical transcription factor in BMP signaling, by promoting the degradation of SMAD ubiquitin regulatory factor 1. Small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of Trb3 blunts the effects of phenamil on BMP signaling and osteogenesis. Thus, phenamil induces osteogenic differentiation, at least in part, through Trb3-dependent promotion of BMP action. The synergistic use of small molecules such as phenamil along with BMPs may provide new strategies for the promotion of bone healing.					160428	28984	5998	140862	65989	79094	10468	7057	1339	57761	6536	56603	9076

VERNOCHET_ADIPOGENESIS	M2432		19564408	Vernochet C,Peres SB,Davis KE,McDonald ME,Qiang L,Wang H,Scherer PE,Farmer SR		Table 1			MOUSE_GENE_SYMBOL	Arthur Liberzon	Broad Institute	Genes up-regulated during adipogenic differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells (preadipocyte) and down-regulated by troglitazone [PubChem=5591].	White adipose tissue (WAT) stores energy in the form of triglycerides, whereas brown tissue (BAT) expends energy, primarily by oxidizing lipids. WAT also secretes many cytokines and acute-phase proteins that contribute to insulin resistance in obese subjects. In this study, we have investigated the mechanisms by which activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) with synthetic agonists induces a brown phenotype in white adipocytes in vivo and in vitro. We demonstrate that this phenotypic conversion is characterized by repression of a set of white fat genes (visceral white), including the resistin, angiotensinogen, and chemerin genes, in addition to induction of brown-specific genes, such as Ucp-1. Importantly, the level of expression of the visceral white genes is high in mesenteric and gonadal WAT depots but low in the subcutaneous WAT depot and in BAT. Mutation of critical amino acids within helix 7 of the ligand-binding domain of PPARgamma prevents inhibition of visceral white gene expression by the synthetic agonists and therefore shows a direct role for PPARgamma in the repression process. Inhibition of the white adipocyte genes also depends on the expression of C/EBPalpha and the corepressors, carboxy-terminal binding proteins 1 and 2 (CtBP1/2). The data further show that repression of resistin and angiotensinogen expression involves recruitment of CtBP1/2, directed by C/EBPalpha, to the minimal promoter of the corresponding genes in response to the PPARgamma ligand. Developing strategies to enhance the brown phenotype in white adipocytes while reducing secretion of stress-related cytokines from visceral WAT is a means to combat obesity-associated disorders.					5468	147495	2167	1050	56729	1572	8639	55350	3240	5919	4060	4158	79646	183	155	6817	2867	117	6272
IM_SREBF1A_TARGETS	M2433		19564420	Im SS,Hammond LE,Yousef L,Nugas-Selby C,Shin DJ,Seo YK,Fong LG,Young SG,Osborne TF		Table 1			SEQ_ACCESSION	Arthur Liberzon	Broad Institute	Genes differentially expressed in liver tissue upon knockout of the 1a isoform of SREBF1 [GeneID=6720].	We generated a line of mice in which sterol regulatory element binding protein 1a (SREBP-1a) was specifically inactivated by insertional mutagenesis. Homozygous mutant mice were completely viable despite expressing SREBP-1a mRNA below 5% of normal, and there were minimal effects on expression of either SREBP-1c or -2. Microarray expression studies in liver, where SREBP-1a mRNA is 1/10 the level of the highly similar SREBP-1c, demonstrated that only a few genes were affected. The only downregulated genes directly linked to lipid metabolism were Srebf1 (which encodes SREBP-1) and Acacb (which encodes acetyl coenzyme A [acetyl-CoA] carboxylase 2 [ACC2], a critical regulator of fatty acyl-CoA partitioning between cytosol and mitochondria). ACC2 regulation is particularly important during food restriction. Similar to Acacb knockout mice, SREBP-1a-deficient mice have lower hepatic triglycerides and higher serum ketones during fasting than wild-type mice. SREBP-1a and -1c have identical DNA binding and dimerization domains; thus, the failure of the more abundant SREBP-1c to substitute for activating hepatic ACC2 must relate to more efficient recruitment of transcriptional coactivators to the more potent SREBP-1a activation domain. Our chromatin immunoprecipitation results support this hypothesis.					475	147991	9706	32	6720

We used a Cre-loxP approach to generate mice with varied expression of hepatic Irs1 and Irs2 to establish the contribution of each protein to hepatic nutrient homeostasis. While nutrient-sensitive transcripts were expressed nearly normally in liver lacking Irs2 (LKO2 mice), these transcripts were significantly dysregulated in liver lacking Irs1 (LKO1 mice) or Irs1 and Irs2 together (DKO mice). Similarly, a set of key gluconeogenic and lipogenic genes was regulated nearly normally by feeding in liver retaining a single Irs1 allele without Irs2 (DKO/1 mice) but was poorly regulated in liver retaining one Irs2 allele without Irs1 (DKO/2 mice). DKO/2 mice, but not DKO/1 mice, also showed impaired glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity-though both Irs1 and Irs2 were required to suppress hepatic glucose production during hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp. In contrast, either hepatic Irs1 or Irs2 mediated suppression of HGP by intracerebroventricular insulin infusion. After 12 weeks on a high-fat diet, postprandial tyrosine phosphorylation of Irs1 increased in livers of control and LKO2 mice, whereas tyrosine phosphorylation of Irs2 decreased in control and LKO1 mice. Moreover, LKO1 mice -- but not LKO2 mice -- that were fed a high-fat diet developed postprandial hyperglycemia.

GATA-2 is an essential transcription factor that regulates multiple aspects of hematopoiesis. Dysregulation of GATA-2 is a hallmark of acute megakaryoblastic leukemia in children with Down syndrome, a malignancy that is defined by the combination of trisomy 21 and a GATA1 mutation. Here, we show that GATA-2 is required for normal megakaryocyte development as well as aberrant megakaryopoiesis in Gata1 mutant cells. Furthermore, we demonstrate that GATA-2 indirectly controls cell cycle progression in GATA-1-deficient megakaryocytes. Genome-wide microarray analysis and chromatin immunoprecipitation studies revealed that GATA-2 regulates a wide set of genes, including cell cycle regulators and megakaryocyte-specific genes. Surprisingly, GATA-2 also negatively regulates the expression of crucial myeloid transcription factors, such as Sfpi1 and Cebpa. In the absence of GATA-1, GATA-2 prevents induction of a latent myeloid gene expression program. Thus, GATA-2 contributes to cell cycle progression and the maintenance of megakaryocyte identity of GATA-1-deficient cells, including GATA-1s-expressing fetal megakaryocyte progenitors. Moreover, our data reveal that overexpression of GATA-2 facilitates aberrant megakaryopoiesis.					79630	83641	6303	57016	93082	391	26253	51744	3603	8992	10552	2647	123	80024	9555	241	11010	1027	56172	4542	23682	2212	9760	26037	8519	9114	23585	567	90634	83442	79626	344405	9404	3956	11031	9687	9840	2992	29909	51763	1176	3133	55851	64781	3240	6891	5080	4258	79153	302	5698	55236	55502	2242	81558	10397	22918	26959	9535	6404	7046	113246	51282	10809	94241	1026	1611	7048	1608	2014	7903	25816	9595	11067	30011	25824	3815	51316	2934	6304	34	2530	1471	51646	4700	960	375035	91860	53373	4161	1337	338339	9990	3087	5294	401258	4299	9236	4353	222487	961	9446	103910	1050	2876	112616	79930	6194	11337	115207	1359	6993	80325	64092	10788	5657	55819	2867	5339	23710	6688	202018	11213	5696	23765	5552	2651	7305	7462	93408	79890	51024	59286	2123	2213	3460	7050	706	1510	9934	10628	3783	122622	694	11182	2549	8878	9476	1820

In vivo skin healing revealed a faster inflammatory stage and wound closure in NFI-C(-/-) mice. Expression of PDGFA and PDGF-receptor alpha were increased in wounds of NFI-C(-/-) mice, explaining the early recruitment of macrophages and fibroblasts.

A common landmark of activated genes is the presence of trimethylation on lysine 4 of histone H3 (H3K4) at promoter regions. Set1/COMPASS was the founding member and is the only H3K4 methylase in Saccharomyces cerevisiae; however, in mammals, at least six H3K4 methylases, Set1A and Set1B and MLL1 to MLL4, are found in COMPASS-like complexes capable of methylating H3K4. To gain further insight into the different roles and functional targets for the H3K4 methylases, we have undertaken a genome-wide analysis of H3K4 methylation patterns in wild-type Mll1(+/+) and Mll1(-)(/)(-) mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). We found that Mll1 is required for the H3K4 trimethylation of less than 5% of promoters carrying this modification. Many of these genes, which include developmental regulators such as Hox genes, show decreased levels of RNA polymerase II recruitment and expression concomitant with the loss of H3K4 methylation. Although Mll1 is only required for the methylation of a subset of Hox genes, menin, a component of the Mll1 and Mll2 complexes, is required for the overwhelming majority of H3K4 methylation at Hox loci. However, the loss of MLL3/MLL4 and/or the Set1 complexes has little to no effect on the H3K4 methylation of Hox loci or their expression levels in these MEFs. Together these data provide insight into the redundancy and specialization of COMPASS-like complexes in mammals and provide evidence for a possible role for Mll1-mediated H3K4 methylation in the regulation of transcriptional initiation.					340419	1606	79695	552	10247	1960	170384	55605	64943	3739	1572	153769	133	4313	192668	1844	3224	121601	9459	338773	27293	773	8705	2255	53832	5167	2887	284	2303	6698	25806	253738	9536	56123	6547	6586	83468	4929	3223	91179	183	1879	6542	6660	4825	254228	11138	3747	55971	722	171586	79987	94235	55384	9182	23426	5744	10447	717	10643	1903	79625	57161	28514	9781	5152	9194	51316	2487	2099	154043	317649	11187	8728	284217	1031	54436	6004	9910	127343	7056	3860	5092	397	136	4323	3131	5083	9694	2296	93663	5797	2173	5075	7049	2307	8532	84858	3569	2297	23194	26191	3209	151887	146760	338442	9734	51319	55092	6342	3489	6423	3557	54757	84159	7373	257194	9514	80303	1896	3215	26499	6913	27330	10687	55323	80323	5341	4322	117581	9935	1535	27071	2920	2115	347902	9404	3226	6776	3052	54805	2626	133418	7360	80183	55819	3945	5080	5308	221421	1036	340596	4958	79745	84978	23328	1746	5603	54209	22925	79827	56129	1800	79689	25890	2882	10144	9902	5169	29116	646	23251	4776	6578	8092	92211	1116	255488	11000	345274	151742	222236	490	6422	9353	5866	7058	3356	27122	65266	11117	54829	2167	5166	4311	8913	8796	10350	54625	6928	3772	50486	1806	9615	3222	2242	2153	6414	4774	9173	3213	29785	56977	55063	3671	64094	126	112817	142685	2625	3225	25992	121227	5273	55281	3216	9249	116039	4217	7051	147111	4256	338707	64843	9760	3290	1300	399694	645638	1291	1292	7546	10417	84141	29091	9563	90161	3959	91768	23092	5737	133686	81621	23508	64093	3698	1901	2201	58494	1601	10631	3229	367	23401	2028	59353	1154	6474	3759	4094	22862	2824	3206	1280	7045	392255	5077	7424	2953	9582	4486	344558	929	443	10003	217	50619	2627	10404

Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARalpha) is an important transcription factor in liver that can be activated physiologically by fasting or pharmacologically by using high-affinity synthetic agonists. Here we initially set out to elucidate the similarities in gene induction between Wy14643 and fasting. Numerous genes were commonly regulated in liver between the two treatments, including many classical PPARalpha target genes, such as Aldh3a2 and Cpt2. Remarkably, several genes induced by Wy14643 were upregulated by fasting independently of PPARalpha, including Lpin2 and St3gal5, suggesting involvement of another transcription factor. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation, Lpin2 and St3gal5 were shown to be direct targets of PPARbeta/delta during fasting, whereas Aldh3a2 and Cpt2 were exclusive targets of PPARalpha. Binding of PPARbeta/delta to the Lpin2 and St3gal5 genes followed the plasma free fatty acid (FFA) concentration, consistent with activation of PPARbeta/delta by plasma FFAs. Subsequent experiments using transgenic and knockout mice for Angptl4, a potent stimulant of adipose tissue lipolysis, confirmed the stimulatory effect of plasma FFAs on Lpin2 and St3gal5 expression levels via PPARbeta/delta. In contrast, the data did not support activation of PPARalpha by plasma FFAs. The results identify Lpin2 and St3gal5 as novel PPARbeta/delta target genes and show that upregulation of gene expression by PPARbeta/delta is sensitive to plasma FFA levels. In contrast, this is not the case for PPARalpha, revealing a novel mechanism for functional differentiation between PPARs.					10005	1375	1666	26291	26063	3295	1962	1632	34	224	948	3158	1376	2110	50486

Chromatin assembly factor 1 (CAF-1) deposits histones H3 and H4 rapidly behind replication forks through an interaction with the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), a DNA polymerase processivity factor that also binds to a number of replication enzymes and other proteins that act on nascent DNA. The mechanisms that enable CAF-1 and other PCNA-binding proteins to function harmoniously at the replication fork are poorly understood. Here we report that the large subunit of human CAF-1 (p150) contains two distinct PCNA interaction peptides (PIPs). The N-terminal PIP binds strongly to PCNA in vitro but, surprisingly, is dispensable for nucleosome assembly and only makes a modest contribution to targeting p150 to DNA replication foci in vivo. In contrast, the internal PIP (PIP2) lacks one of the highly conserved residues of canonical PIPs and binds weakly to PCNA. Surprisingly, PIP2 is essential for nucleosome assembly during DNA replication in vitro and plays a major role in targeting p150 to sites of DNA replication. Unlike canonical PIPs, such as that of p21, the two p150 PIPs are capable of preferentially inhibiting nucleosome assembly, rather than DNA synthesis, suggesting that intrinsic features of these peptides are part of the mechanism that enables CAF-1 to function behind replication forks without interfering with other PCNA-mediated processes.					3375	5078	1113	5502	5699	5126	57393	9935	57586	6518	51738	6726	6750	5950	4760	1506	94121	3949	6833	3670	7421	6586	10590	3630	5539	6514	57369	57818	4825	6447	2641	50674	5080	9783	5697	2302	2487

All-trans retinoic acid (RA) induces transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta)-dependent autocrine growth of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). We have used chromatin immunoprecipitation to map 354 RA receptor (RAR) binding loci in MEFs, most of which were similarly occupied by the RAR alpha and RAR gamma receptors. Only a subset of the genes associated with these loci are regulated by RA, among which are several critical components of the TGF-beta pathway. We also show RAR binding to a novel series of target genes involved in cell cycle regulation, transformation, and metastasis, suggesting new pathways by which RA may regulate proliferation and cancer.

Previously, it was shown that the CTCF paralogous gene, BORIS (brother of the regulator of imprinted sites) is expressed in male germ cells, but its function in spermatogenesis has not been defined. To develop an understanding of the functional activities of BORIS, we generated BORIS knockout (KO) mice. Mice homozygous for the null allele had a defect in spermatogenesis that resulted in small testes associated with increased cell death. The defect was evident as early as postnatal day 21 and was manifested by delayed production of haploid cells. By gene expression profiling, we found that transcript levels for Gal3st1 (also known as cerebroside sulfotransferase [CST]), known to play a crucial role in meiosis, were dramatically reduced in BORIS KO testes. We found that CST is expressed in testis as a novel testis-specific isoform, CST form F(TS), that has a short exon 1f. We showed that BORIS bound to and activated the promoter of CST form F(TS). Mutation of the BORIS binding site in the promoter reduced the ability of BORIS to activate the promoter. These findings define transcriptional regulation of CST expression as a critical role for BORIS in spermatogenesis.					51602	5539	7342	1731	132	1158	23195	55861	619279	4618	817	7031

The retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein (pRB) and related p107 and p130 pocket proteins function together with the E2F transcription factors to repress gene expression during the cell cycle and development. Recent biochemical studies have identified the multisubunit DREAM pocket protein complexes in Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans in regulating developmental gene repression. Although a conserved DREAM complex has also been identified in mammalian cells, its physiological function in vivo has not been determined. Here we addressed this question by targeting Lin9, a conserved core subunit of DREAM. We found that LIN9 is essential for early embryonic development and for viability of adult mice. Loss of Lin9 abolishes proliferation and leads to multiple defects in mitosis and cytokinesis because of its requirement for the expression of a large set of mitotic genes, such as Plk1, Aurora A, and Kif20a. While Lin9 heterozygous mice are healthy and normal, they are more susceptible to lung tumorigenesis induced by oncogenic c-Raf than wild-type mice. Together these experiments provide the first direct genetic evidence for the role of LIN9 in development and mitotic gene regulation and they suggest that it may function as a haploinsufficient tumor suppressor.					89782	10112	51203	4646	7153	9493	57082	26271	800	259266	4288	3148	984	64682	80124	55165	1058	899	891	6790	5347	55632	3161	1062	9918	1063	157313	11004

The circadian timing system coordinates many aspects of mammalian physiology and behavior in synchrony with the external light/dark cycle. These rhythms are driven by endogenous molecular clocks present in most body cells. Many clock outputs are transcriptional regulators, suggesting that clock genes primarily control physiology through indirect pathways. Here, we show that Krüppel-like factor 10 (KLF10) displays a robust circadian expression pattern in wild-type mouse liver but not in clock-deficient Bmal1 knockout mice. Consistently, the Klf10 promoter recruited the BMAL1 core clock protein and was transactivated by the CLOCK-BMAL1 heterodimer through a conserved E-box response element. Profiling the liver transcriptome from Klf10(-/-) mice identified 158 regulated genes with significant enrichment for transcripts involved in lipid and carbohydrate metabolism. Importantly, approximately 56% of these metabolic genes are clock controlled. Male Klf10(-/-) mice displayed postprandial and fasting hyperglycemia, a phenotype accompanied by a significant time-of-day-dependent upregulation of the gluconeogenic gene Pepck and increased hepatic glucose production. Consistently, functional data showed that the proximal Pepck promoter is repressed directly by KLF10. Klf10(-/-) females were normoglycemic but displayed higher plasma triglycerides.

The circadian timing system coordinates many aspects of mammalian physiology and behavior in synchrony with the external light/dark cycle. These rhythms are driven by endogenous molecular clocks present in most body cells. Many clock outputs are transcriptional regulators, suggesting that clock genes primarily control physiology through indirect pathways. Here, we show that Krüppel-like factor 10 (KLF10) displays a robust circadian expression pattern in wild-type mouse liver but not in clock-deficient Bmal1 knockout mice. Consistently, the Klf10 promoter recruited the BMAL1 core clock protein and was transactivated by the CLOCK-BMAL1 heterodimer through a conserved E-box response element. Profiling the liver transcriptome from Klf10(-/-) mice identified 158 regulated genes with significant enrichment for transcripts involved in lipid and carbohydrate metabolism. Importantly, approximately 56% of these metabolic genes are clock controlled. Male Klf10(-/-) mice displayed postprandial and fasting hyperglycemia, a phenotype accompanied by a significant time-of-day-dependent upregulation of the gluconeogenic gene Pepck and increased hepatic glucose production. Consistently, functional data showed that the proximal Pepck promoter is repressed directly by KLF10. Klf10(-/-) females were normoglycemic but displayed higher plasma triglycerides. Correspondingly, rhythmic gene expression of components of the lipogenic pathway, including Srebp1c, Fas, and Elovl6, was altered in females. Collectively, these data establish KLF10 as a required circadian transcriptional regulator that links the molecular clock to energy metabolism in the liver.					29927	1499	1827	948	81671	7114	165530	8876	2028	170392	2219	51009	8473	2819	285855	28234	65985	58505	57142	23198	56994	6514	9060	60481	10628	50808	366	1520	6428	1727

Approximately 100 mouse genes undergo genomic imprinting, whereby one of the two parental alleles is epigenetically silenced. Imprinted genes influence processes including development, X chromosome inactivation, obesity, schizophrenia, and diabetes, motivating the identification of all imprinted loci. Local sequence features have been used to predict candidate imprinted genes, but rigorous testing using reciprocal crosses validated only three, one of which resided in previously identified imprinting clusters. Here we show that specific epigenetic features in mouse cells correlate with imprinting status in mice, and we identify hundreds of additional genes predicted to be imprinted in the mouse. We used a multitiered approach to validate imprinted expression, including use of a custom single nucleotide polymorphism array and traditional molecular methods. Of 65 candidates subjected to molecular assays for allele-specific expression, we found 10 novel imprinted genes that were maternally expressed in the placenta.					8788	4486	2887	4692	5445	5923	8418	1028	116969	3482	430	57194	8926	85477	7490	4232	6581	799	7337	7054	2628	1634	3356	55384	4676	55364	3481	51666	55089	5178	1644	26958	25797	10077	266812	5002	5067	6638	3784	283120	6582	54551	344	7681	7262	10078	100271873	3630	5446	150684	57713	1812	5925	55607	114879	1717	23089	5325	4826	975	51725	8910	2778

Previous studies have shown that tumor progression in the transgenic adenocarcinoma of mouse prostate (TRAMP) model is characterized by global DNA hypomethylation initiated during early-stage disease and locus-specific DNA hypermethylation occurring predominantly in late-stage disease. Here, we utilized Dnmt1 hypomorphic alleles to examine the role of Dnmt1 in normal prostate development and in prostate cancer in TRAMP. Prostate tissue morphology and differentiation status was normal in Dnmt1 hypomorphic mice, despite global DNA hypomethylation. TRAMP; Dnmt1 hypomorphic mice also displayed global DNA hypomethylation, but were characterized by altered tumor phenotype. Specifically, TRAMP; Dnmt1 hypomorphic mice exhibited slightly increased tumor incidence and significantly increased pathological progression at early ages and, conversely, displayed slightly decreased tumor incidence and significantly decreased pathological progression at advanced ages. Remarkably, hypomorphic Dnmt1 expression abrogated local and distant site macrometastases. Thus, Dnmt1 has tumor suppressor activity in early-stage prostate cancer, and oncogenic activity in late stage prostate cancer and metastasis. Consistent with the biological phenotype, epigenomic studies revealed that TRAMP; Dnmt1 hypomorphic mice show dramatically reduced CpG island and promoter DNA hypermethylation in late-stage primary tumors compared to control mice. Taken together, the data reveal a crucial role for Dnmt1 in prostate cancer and suggest that Dnmt1-targeted interventions may have utility specifically for advanced and/or metastatic prostate cancer.					6755	3034	2865	6512	646625	4160	187	4656	6559	10388	129521	54937	5961	400508

Both insulin and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling systems are important for adipocyte differentiation. Analysis of gene expression in BMP7-treated fibroblasts revealed a coordinated change in insulin signaling components by BMP7. To further investigate the cross talk between insulin and BMP signaling systems in brown adipogenesis, we examined the effect of BMP7 in insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1)-deficient brown preadipocytes, which exhibit a severe defect in differentiation. Treatment of these cells with BMP7 for 3 days prior to adipogenic induction restored differentiation and expression of brown adipogenic markers. The high level of adipogenic inhibitor preadipocyte factor 1 (Pref-1) in IRS-1-null cells was markedly reduced by 3 days of BMP7 treatment, and analysis of the 1.3-kb pref-1 promoter revealed 9 putative Smad binding elements (SBEs), suggesting that BMP7 could directly suppress Pref-1 expression, thereby allowing the initiation of the adipogenic program. Using a series of sequential deletion mutants of the pref-1 promoter linked to the luciferase gene and chromatin immunoprecipitation, we demonstrate that the promoter-proximal SBE (-192/-184) was critical in mediating BMP7's suppressive effect on pref-1 transcription. Together, these data suggest cross talk between the insulin and BMP signaling systems by which BMP7 can rescue brown adipogenesis in cells with insulin resistance.					3265	5286	2887	5295	3667	208	207	2888	2885	4641	4217	10603	5595	6446

Lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1), which demethylates mono- and dimethylated histone H3-Lys4 as part of a complex including CoREST and histone deacetylases (HDACs), is essential for embryonic development in the mouse beyond embryonic day 6.5 (e6.5). To determine the role of LSD1 during this early period of embryogenesis, we have generated loss-of-function gene trap mice and conditional knockout embryonic stem (ES) cells. Analysis of postimplantation gene trap embryos revealed that LSD1 expression, and therefore function, is restricted to the epiblast. Conditional deletion of LSD1 in mouse ES cells, the in vitro counterpart of the epiblast, revealed a reduction in CoREST protein and associated HDAC activity, resulting in a global increase in histone H3-Lys56 acetylation, but not H3-Lys4 methylation. Despite this biochemical perturbation, ES cells with LSD1 deleted proliferate normally and retain stem cell characteristics. Loss of LSD1 causes the aberrant expression of 588 genes, including those coding for transcription factors with roles in anterior/posterior patterning and limb development, such as brachyury, Hoxb7, Hoxd8, and retinoic acid receptor γ (RARγ). The gene coding for brachyury, a key regulator of mesodermal differentiation, is a direct target gene of LSD1 and is overexpressed in e6.5 Lsd1 gene trap embryos. Thus, LSD1 regulates the expression and appropriate timing of key developmental regulators, as part of the LSD1/CoREST/HDAC complex, during early embryonic development.					55	23328	83844	5337	26191	128209	1001	127294	7263	3682	9563	202	729330	133491	6861	340990	221184	51393	3429	127	8644	85438	6404	9	9172	284486	3071	157855	6565	8519	8728	57125	57716	22999	400746	7162	6441	644054	100507055	3234	5406	100127206	57835	3123	6622	51226	131669	144165	676	654348	728591	7439	353238	181	55353	55906	7940	7070	391004	1381	158521	79101	149643	10057	88	25780	4504	351	340602	80168	147945	79983	10389	883	915	4921	9246	2267	6490	54097	219537	4915	79136	4300	6453	608	6785	84709	732	125488	58528	84456	51616	9547	1026	4109	440603	221687	56995	1280	170589	149699	51199	1369	7512	200879	5939	5649	154141	64208	4023	25797	63036	80021	10553	25925	283875	83659	153769	57146	55268	4935	7136	4599	51365	2940	84941	54769	241	5655	1208	285126	1562	7103	287	64081	145957	92241	131831	54102	2315	3814	5172	131375	148170	25801	1179	81501	94120	1990	51316	6691	7107	165082	613209	89886	7504	4258	4489	8419	54502	1188	978	151835	4110	10100	3959	10148	121355	7781	26577	4061	1421	8572	8538	58495	7278	158297	56156	53827	1809	2766	127534	22893	220963	4313	79814	1902	154313	25984	3119	5145	400629	54566	1780	78986	5476	23593	57663	81790	6527	9033	8537	374355	2947	83734	54682	10241	1427	9447	613210	4133	4008	1346	57520	84557	503834	6716	3417	8676	342933	84532	4633	6540	285641	121278	3614	6820	4345	1116	6370	2273	10693	199857	55287	10157	283869	121599	4938	6862	4635	2171	23366	26085	26998	26353	4153	4610	972	3909	5522	391365	3217	7138	55212	5967	401251	29969	66037	6414	54967	366	26047	6712	64420	202374

Our work is novel in establishing such isoform-specific differences in ES cells.					5308	56288	84288	132864	64089	58524	81848	10181	26578	23597	51123	54941	2571	345611	79609	94137	171023	54799	5763	1984	3680	28985	4248	5371	57621	80150	4760	10477	284612	167826	85300	2969	55629	10693	1499	6422	5080	10370	4886	3218	55081	585	329	401687	84919	23063	387718	27445	26355	1379	9695	7021	9191	23543	50650	7840	342979	10062	10637	55005	6430	8745	27020	123879	5250	23363	55254	3516	154865	9	22905	9738	201627	3425	7547	5992	5533	85363	3918	2800	27030	26333	58495	347731	164380	387914	10082	7862	23562	2039	8545	133418	83444	1290	8355	403278	7003	84133	6224	10381	9429	9901	11063	51601	55765	347733	5618	23586	1386	151230	55183	51268	5515	79752	10926	6520	8364	26958	3675	134083	9824	151651	10517	126299	57017	3131	1948	63877	23468	7050	64081	494115	4064	10678	2596	160492	10407	50640	2980	28511	65125	144124	10116	25813	154743	80119	93621	56300	27022	1964	4869	9053	55209	6252	160777	23644	311	10225	687	29126	89978	9847	360023	390212	51569	25898	26341	10521	8915	219623	54509	205428	10951	54469	54904	5007	23213	23492	23677	11033	10385	1364	7090	56832	24	1604	10625	79822	83439	8940	667	9655	159013	10432	261729	2107	25842	80704	953	6917	51573	9468	9844	9643	57082	1827	6489	10434	138255	115752	8939	6529	345651	4320	144097	25904	55213	10527	55188	57818	8165	3843	9564	103910	5460	11001	8340	4835	55734	9734	65991	64745	2572	10451	5966	1647	79718	29766	224	29058	9654	54579	55704	57509	7941	7029	27430	4211	5818	83734	55884	23421	9096	1907	55504	59343	4033	140767	57414	3010	2165	114883	10671	115350	10446	4698	64222	80323	3201	150864	6708	56850	84159	81847	9350	130951	6667	55839	7475	137362	10642	57628	389766	93587	9777	6691	10186	9337	79722	4889	9953	3827	10867	7539	4719	3398	85004	344875	10550	26118	151647	25998	27131	91147	2553	5954	54617	29121	961	3815	3017	196513	5478	3705	57092	26045	7562	8028	55907	65110	84456	6696	58516	7200	2730	3009	64112	7053	6206	1462	7367	51315	7798	81839	9019	23262	781	6421	85437	5813	23219	474	4300	8061	443	7044	84002	5514	22795	55023	55885	80013	3280	84916	4780	9798	115362	51091	6670	63971	23158	5782	60313	54332	6738	8861	7357	8643	4690	5096	7320	11174	4302	85444	140456	2119	3094	54458	94134	4838	22881	10690	7728	10927	7743	10806	84693	5972	63979	29896	55706	51433	64795	2043	51222	200734	79801	10299	55071	9183	8317	5931	151827	54662	7916	85457	22931	3930	26064	55186	9611	3294	92421	9703	65003	27164	4092	55608	9592	115677	56245	54443	90843	401265	390010	6711	55211	8036	8404	1182	83604	2939	1159	7401	116039	9853	128338	5713	54764	3833	659	8491	9729	286183	2796	9402	79660	344805	9242	7419	50674	9821	8935	7852	2842	9118	122830	57226	54954	153241	6515	57157	9124	57167	90204	201973	64764	11030	64840	553115	127602	2169	3983	8611	4779	3364	8439	10049	10042	22868	79649	280636	140901	8543	2146	55529	3447	81168	10413	23198	84034	83641	57142	8573	57822	652	2491	580	55632	85465	952	2846	7079	51067	7035	22927	114907	10313	78997	11252	836	9748	4217	11328	80034	404203	80311

Murine embryonic stem (ES) cells are defined by continuous self-renewal and pluripotency. A diverse repertoire of protein isoforms arising from alternative splicing is expressed in ES cells without defined biological roles. Sall4, a transcription factor essential for pluripotency, exists as two isoforms (Sall4a and Sall4b). Both isoforms can form homodimers and a heterodimer with each other, and each can interact with Nanog. By genomewide location analysis, we determined that Sall4a and Sall4b have overlapping, but not identical binding sites within the ES cell genome. In addition, Sall4b, but not Sall4a, binds preferentially to highly expressed loci in ES cells. Sall4a and Sall4b binding sites are distinguished by both epigenetic marks at target loci and their clustering with binding sites of other pluripotency factors. When ES cells expressing a single isoform of Sall4 are generated, Sall4b alone could maintain the pluripotent state, although it could not completely suppress all differentiation markers. Sall4a and Sall4b collaborate in maintenance of the pluripotent state but play distinct roles. Our work is novel in establishing such isoform-specific differences in ES cells.					84678	123	345062	7158	9295	8444	11329	123720	23555	7707	8115	9982	199704	388	285025	143884	58494	56965	55219	845	10161	29777	7022	440	130888	1284	121536	2926	51706	27101	11342	79683	3801	339976	10253	6645	54627	2150	8521	144363	8861	285527	9782	1490	23516	10365	6523	26122	9499	4747	9590	2263	6657	84891	79923	22863	405	1106	22803	23576	2697	56034	121512	63978	2053	100133941	9766	2138	9919	8320	9589	55636	401546	677	23016	142678	23242	6576	619279	7593	79684	158219	9588	22943	441376	23767	9331	9221	161742	85416	257240	23682	4149	2823	440138	56888	81796	29842	162966	3925	3018	586	54407	10672	8352	2115	1471	30062	55959	9330	57561	1149	8519	51104	8473	3013	163259	7532	23429	100131897	23446	160851	3572	25834	79912	51170	169200	3181	3075	55205	9887	5738	6441	2335	8601	2260	55972	51366	4131	120935	57057	3672	642843	55787	4043	57559	57507	157769	84281	55609	1788	9520	4885	51088	10509	255926	51141	4821	9407	54545	57521	8125	53840	279	1848	2249	23370	3074	388335	3720	5170	10614	5978	5015	190	3417	57449	201456	7569	2825	9874	1911	92255	2651	2707	23648	4077	9448	8970	26135	8577	200879	56829	7314	121599	5162	57149	7163	7157	10262	346171	9212	7424	7706	201134	5136	84196	25843	64841	57673	7465	221035	64207	115426	10492	11130	7378	112495	4613	23321	83877	58986	5412	353189	132625	79602	51360

The highly related mammalian Sin3A and Sin3B proteins provide a versatile platform for chromatin-modifying activities. Sin3-containing complexes play a role in gene repression through deacetylation of nucleosomes. Here, we explore a role for Sin3 in myogenesis by examining the phenotypes resulting from acute somatic deletion of both isoforms in vivo and from primary myotubes in vitro. Myotubes ablated for Sin3A alone, but not Sin3B, displayed gross defects in sarcomere structure that were considerably enhanced upon simultaneous ablation of both isoforms. Massively parallel sequencing of Sin3A- and Sin3B-bound genomic loci revealed a subset of target genes directly involved in sarcomere function that are positively regulated by Sin3A and Sin3B proteins. Both proteins were coordinately recruited to a substantial number of genes. Interestingly, depletion of Sin3B led to compensatory increases in Sin3A recruitment at certain target loci, but Sin3B was never found to compensate for Sin3A loss. Thus, our analyses describe a novel transcriptional role for Sin3A and Sin3B proteins associated with maintenance of differentiated muscle cells.					1163	8502	8548	1967	6830	84437	5914	63934	58504	10456	523	5520	6293	57537	29985	394	195827	51068	51021	27158	8859	10827	79709	7818	10464	7918	10162	2799	51514	8505	3949	55028	55032	79056	2787	7347	79676	50488	29889	4783	57222	84844	2671	6455	255061	55737	2109	58478	4879	1182	9341	57486	84138	9816	10908	7184	51495	124930	7296	6382	51255	26018	11177	54921	348180	55784	5257	51106	56996	57209	81671	60626	79727	23177	3921	81617	84289	5211	51586	7743	5395	4601	57576	10152	2077	9925	493753	55907	65260	55248	257397	51605	55055	11270	1635	25929	26037	50809	132320	2314	9653	63899	51491	11060	84273	55010	1876	147929	5532	5373	55905	171023	10557	92259	57406	440145	3159	2512	148523	29789	1798	57465	10849	78988	317781	1004	815	60401	27013	55336	55198	51614	51393	5770	3976	10120	89782	115703	10066	3224	10397	11221	283989	64115	2272	10018	2262	6648	1385	6902	128061	4969	3162	113791	22948	64793	6480	219654	55002	79567	4676	79158	25796	10095	7082	84975	64925	84321	8293	9657	64858	55012	54676	54516	8078	25959	54386	22852	80219	1849	129880	28996	6835	686	308	57179	54799	253832	1844	90135	29104	51650	3419	6751	81490	131474	6229	441150	84864	4646	6203	9679	57414	191	23417	55972	6992	11342	284099	8480	10248	5898	5954	8674	10057	1184	10635	10953	8801	10072
BOUDOUKHA_BOUND_BY_IGF2BP2	M2525		20956565	Boudoukha S,Cuvellier S,Polesskaya A		Table 1S			SEQ_ACCESSION	Arthur Liberzon	Broad Institute	Transcripts bound to IGF2BP2 [GeneID=10644] complexes and differentially regulated in myoblasts with IGF2BP2 [GeneID=10644] knockdown by RNAi.	Insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF-2) mRNA-binding proteins (IMPs) are a family of posttranscriptional regulatory factors with well-understood roles in embryonic development and cancer but with poorly characterized functions in normal adult cells and tissues. We now show that IMP-2, the most ubiquitously expressed member of the family, is abundant in human and mouse adult skeletal myoblasts, where it is indispensable for cell motility and for stabilization of microtubules. To explore the functions of IMP-2, we analyzed the transcripts that were differentially regulated in IMP-2-depleted myoblasts and bound to IMP-2 in normal myoblasts. Among them were the mRNAs of PINCH-2, an important mediator of cell adhesion and motility, and MURF-3, a microtubule-stabilizing protein. By gain- and loss-of-function assays and gel shift experiments, we show that IMP-2 regulates the expression of PINCH-2 and MURF-3 proteins via direct binding to their mRNAs. Upregulation of PINCH-2 in IMP-2-depleted myoblasts is the key event responsible for their decreased motility. Our data reveal how the posttranscriptional regulation of gene expression by IMP-2 contributes to the control of adhesion structures and stable microtubules and demonstrate an important function for IMP-2 in cellular motility.					8405	8826	55847	3930	283120	687	5093	192286	81631	9559	11091	79719	6277	10491	4124	4116	5270	2059	975	55679	6204	6388	201895	1350	25873	9551	6175	527	7411	84277	10952	83460	595	3304	63874	6675	7139	4666	8774	10630	2495	362	64393	6166	8682	29801	55970	11168	4694	84967	1351	1523	25972	441150	10772	80351	7135	51542	23378	8673	6233	23612	8347	131474	10397	896	56925	10058	140823	1410	10490	3207	84722	23625	84668	158293	4515	58527	57159	27351	11099	51257	10430	51141	26985	3797	1435	487	23136	8655	10098	2019	406886	7205	514	203	5782	900	51699	6209	7514	122961	2277	11031	2197	6217	23658	6146	7322	1678	6191

Autophagy has been implicated in many physiological and pathological processes. Accordingly, there is a growing scientific need to accurately identify, quantify, and manipulate the process of autophagy. However, as autophagy involves dynamic and complicated processes, it is often analyzed incorrectly. In this Primer, we discuss methods to monitor autophagy and to modulate autophagic activity, with a primary focus on mammalian macroautophagy.					55626	9776	81671	9474	9140	11337	53349	9821	79065	9706	1639	8408	10533	60673	11345	5289	83734	8493	64422

Mechanical ventilation (MV) with tidal volumes of 10-12 ml/kg is considered safe in the absence of acute lung injury (ALI). However, recent studies show that, when lung injury is already present, tidal volumes of this magnitude increase inflammation and injury in the lungs. We hypothesized that MV with tidal volumes of 10-ml/kg can also function as a cofactor in the initiation of ALI by modulating the transcriptional response to bacterial products. To test this hypothesis, we developed a mouse model in which MV did not independently cause inflammation or injury but augmented the inflammatory response to low-dose aspirated LPS and promoted development of ALI. We analyzed gene expression in lungs from 24 mice assigned to four different groups: control, MV only, intratracheal LPS only, and MV + LPS. There were twice as many differentially regulated genes in the MV + LPS group compared with the LPS-only group and 10 times as many differentially regulated genes compared with the MV-only group. For genes up-regulated by LPS treatment alone, the addition of MV further augmented expression. Cytokine concentrations in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and tissue distribution of an intracellular protein, GADD45-gamma, correlated with mRNA levels. We conclude that MV with conventional tidal volumes enhanced the transcriptional response to LPS and promoted development of ALI.					55647	7127	4939	3665	8744	7378	23648	1439	2669	2633	3553	6348	3937	1230	4502	9615	2643	9636	5341	10875	3552	129607	92610	729230	2920	467	7057	345611	4210	7051	5209	9180	22834	2710	9590	6347	8477	10912	64135	728	23120	1437	133	2209	338339	6403	6361	6402	7941	1462	1052	9021	3600	3684	259307	602	597	3726	11277	1536	65108	4600	6503	3557	7850	22797	5172	317671	64231	384	5054	11274	9507	6772	115361	7940	7076	2152	4783	4940	7097	53831	9516	2919	1827	7980	929	2162	7128	26502	837	1326	2207	9023	3433	23764	51296	3434	10148	5329	4792	4489	6351	6773	100506736	3569	338442	26246	56300	6648	3627	6482	8819	8728	1441	4084	5971	2212	93978	6372	9034	683	5959	3263	26253	1503	6364	64332

INTRODUCTION: Molecular characterization of the normal epithelial cell types that reside in the mammary gland is an important step toward understanding pathways that regulate self-renewal, lineage commitment, and differentiation along the hierarchy. Here we determined the gene expression signatures of four distinct subpopulations isolated from the mouse mammary gland. The epithelial cell signatures were used to interrogate mouse models of mammary tumorigenesis and to compare with their normal human counterpart subsets to identify conserved genes and networks.METHODS: RNA was prepared from freshly sorted mouse mammary cell subpopulations (mammary stem cell (MaSC)-enriched, committed luminal progenitor, mature luminal and stromal cell) and used for gene expression profiling analysis on the Illumina platform. Gene signatures were derived and compared with those previously reported for the analogous normal human mammary cell subpopulations. The mouse and human epithelial subset signatures were then subjected to Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) to identify conserved pathways.RESULTS: The four mouse mammary cell subpopulations exhibited distinct gene signatures. Comparison of these signatures with the molecular profiles of different mouse models of mammary tumorigenesis revealed that tumors arising in MMTV-Wnt-1 and p53-/- mice were enriched for MaSC-subset genes, whereas the gene profiles of MMTV-Neu and MMTV-PyMT tumors were most concordant with the luminal progenitor cell signature. Comparison of the mouse mammary epithelial cell signatures with their human counterparts revealed substantial conservation of genes, whereas IPA highlighted a number of conserved pathways in the three epithelial subsets.CONCLUSIONS: The conservation of genes and pathways across species further validates the use of the mouse as a model to study mammary gland development and highlights pathways that are likely to govern cell-fate decisions and differentiation. It is noteworthy that many of the conserved genes in the MaSC population have been considered as epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) signature genes. Therefore, the expression of these genes in tumor cells may reflect basal epithelial cell characteristics and not necessarily cells that have undergone an EMT.

INTRODUCTION: Molecular characterization of the normal epithelial cell types that reside in the mammary gland is an important step toward understanding pathways that regulate self-renewal, lineage commitment, and differentiation along the hierarchy. Here we determined the gene expression signatures of four distinct subpopulations isolated from the mouse mammary gland. The epithelial cell signatures were used to interrogate mouse models of mammary tumorigenesis and to compare with their normal human counterpart subsets to identify conserved genes and networks.METHODS: RNA was prepared from freshly sorted mouse mammary cell subpopulations (mammary stem cell (MaSC)-enriched, committed luminal progenitor, mature luminal and stromal cell) and used for gene expression profiling analysis on the Illumina platform. Gene signatures were derived and compared with those previously reported for the analogous normal human mammary cell subpopulations. The mouse and human epithelial subset signatures were then subjected to Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) to identify conserved pathways.RESULTS: The four mouse mammary cell subpopulations exhibited distinct gene signatures. Comparison of these signatures with the molecular profiles of different mouse models of mammary tumorigenesis revealed that tumors arising in MMTV-Wnt-1 and p53-/- mice were enriched for MaSC-subset genes, whereas the gene profiles of MMTV-Neu and MMTV-PyMT tumors were most concordant with the luminal progenitor cell signature. Comparison of the mouse mammary epithelial cell signatures with their human counterparts revealed substantial conservation of genes, whereas IPA highlighted a number of conserved pathways in the three epithelial subsets.CONCLUSIONS: The conservation of genes and pathways across species further validates the use of the mouse as a model to study mammary gland development and highlights pathways that are likely to govern cell-fate decisions and differentiation. It is noteworthy that many of the conserved genes in the MaSC population have been considered as epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) signature genes. Therefore, the expression of these genes in tumor cells may reflect basal epithelial cell characteristics and not necessarily cells that have undergone an EMT. Comparative analyses of normal mouse epithelial subsets with murine tumor models have implicated distinct cell types in contributing to tumorigenesis in the different models.					3880	57535	7113	3169	389816	79083	57530	55930	1755	84152	10538	4582	56521	1365	80736	10158	4057	638	84000	27134	3620	1672	147798	5618	284340	54502	2065	2568	3875	92840	2125	2706	9121	11012	29842	154141	79679	4645	2099	113452	113675	5002	1366	64078	9073	149428	8942	481	7127	283537	200879	2166	128218	222	5603	9076	85415	8470	5420	6523	94121	6820	171177	389084	25803	3382	283229	29841	685	148534	1364	58472	1999	7052	23225	634	283987	8538	54847	10040	27076	9455	23624	91894	6768	340348	8884	10406	57221	2886	7124	201266	149466	57111	25801	10788	100133941	7464	155066	622	80223	27071	51280	338440	2064	91862	58489	5025	65266	10519	7100	54020	25791	54682	21	81607	27352	57460	338442	57698	56474	29887	10553	9649	23097	760	117177	220	929	7286	79774	23242	79961	340277	79784	388588	7263	50853	135932	79755	55959	11138	25907	1741	54897	84836	27111	1718	2710	2582	11046	6813	5493	22875	127018	55061	3669	2258	93210	92714	59307	55760	84795	84876	6692	157285	55258	55713	8045	11022	54961	2444	9368	5777	79671	27237	10312	7433	9145	8906	84885	4214	26270	79885	91947	3249	339229	25934	3959	151636	8612	7485	2752	3856	26262	4072	26030	1182	6452	51071	80237	286676	64087	9961	10955	221178	1717	79090	25950	122970	112752	84952	3029	83541	57648	57147	81932	10755	10809	56672	57662	26873	399512	80724	5590	55620	987	373156	3712	6097	53373	23443	102	57414	84179	318	23423	26091	83451	403313	6653	1376	822	7163	7915	5696	6776	57504	95	92359	5827	202243	84269	55971	23408	64374	51599	84105	5716	4151	4528	56994	8349	114884	51088	81622	5050	148327	120	79624	7390	5585	6239	1962	10053	196743	55128	5058	55163	10559	9	5859	27315	128989	80021	129642	55907	119391	29886	8495	3141	1316	25998	9648	57763	65084	11079	57509	7020	5226	7072	11066	79132	79932	10043	5869	6470	55861	55741	3416	10005	2625	5601	999	54458	55322	4701	80347	54494	7579	79767	2035	50484	4351	2733	55204	54845	152100	55856	7098	147807	92370	7108	23130	23637	9342	7251	65249	307	51231	3460	387921	124961	84440	57231	5989	84068	11094	92960	57409	29763	51360	57189	10535	84282	56674	91612	27068	57583	79023	23095	79053	26063	5792	3430	11160	55334	602	55300	9482	55766	29907	10038	90407	10499	23786	4758	94081	10552	139341	10585	5188	114609	51520	10239	254359	5423	25917	529	310	900	54460	23536	7084	79621	10901	6146	6881	84720	55177	51027	23471	64421	210	11216	130617	51091	5194	65005	114987	4521	140461	85013	8772	10693	6778	29071	10956	9991	5892	84964	2631	5720	4731	55819	83933	79078	10640

Comparative analyses of normal mouse epithelial subsets with murine tumor models have implicated distinct cell types in contributing to tumorigenesis in the different models.					3169	56521	79083	6690	158158	10538	27324	3158	1917	4435	6833	5618	6542	9121	222	30061	54361	25803	92840	6820	5241	5816	154141	8600	7052	55640	2166	5002	2099	4602	65266	2267	283987	214	57221	10103	80307	7474	6926	26030	6272	149466	80212	80736	6698	155066	2582	117854	27075	150696	80127	7477	23550	54897	11221	81607	5255	55890	5446	79885	8362	51088	58986	5777	2258	10912	256329	6545	3597	79443	65982	285282	56917	55793	55502	784	2539	221	54869	222484	55002	352909	58476	130888	128989	259230	3212	2081	28996	57037	85446	3911	79085	3291	286451	282679	83450	2766	8363	92370	27092	26027	4211	9663	164656	22955	10298	7283	81552	10347	29800	54904	9695	8945	26276	55709

INTRODUCTION: Molecular characterization of the normal epithelial cell types that reside in the mammary gland is an important step toward understanding pathways that regulate self-renewal, lineage commitment, and differentiation along the hierarchy. Here we determined the gene expression signatures of four distinct subpopulations isolated from the mouse mammary gland. The epithelial cell signatures were used to interrogate mouse models of mammary tumorigenesis and to compare with their normal human counterpart subsets to identify conserved genes and networks.METHODS: RNA was prepared from freshly sorted mouse mammary cell subpopulations (mammary stem cell (MaSC)-enriched, committed luminal progenitor, mature luminal and stromal cell) and used for gene expression profiling analysis on the Illumina platform. Gene signatures were derived and compared with those previously reported for the analogous normal human mammary cell subpopulations. The mouse and human epithelial subset signatures were then subjected to Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) to identify conserved pathways.RESULTS: The four mouse mammary cell subpopulations exhibited distinct gene signatures. Comparison of these signatures with the molecular profiles of different mouse models of mammary tumorigenesis revealed that tumors arising in MMTV-Wnt-1 and p53-/- mice were enriched for MaSC-subset genes, whereas the gene profiles of MMTV-Neu and MMTV-PyMT tumors were most concordant with the luminal progenitor cell signature. Comparison of the mouse mammary epithelial cell signatures with their human counterparts revealed substantial conservation of genes, whereas IPA highlighted a number of conserved pathways in the three epithelial subsets.CONCLUSIONS: The conservation of genes and pathways across species further validates the use of the mouse as a model to study mammary gland development and highlights pathways that are likely to govern cell-fate decisions and differentiation. It is noteworthy that many of the conserved genes in the MaSC population have been considered as epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) signature genes. Therefore, the expression of these genes in tumor cells may reflect basal epithelial cell characteristics and not necessarily cells that have undergone an EMT. Comparative analyses of normal mouse epithelial subsets with murine tumor models have implicated distinct cell types in contributing to tumorigenesis in the different models.					284217	165	11167	55214	1284	3486	348	1282	6591	6507	6422	26002	2995	7049	342667	8404	10580	121551	84281	2882	128553	1291	10763	2171	8460	121227	834	800	1292	5654	51285	355	5311	1601	6663	1956	1410	144165	3714	366	4023	83604	4915	55117	7431	2113	1307	7091	126374	6354	11217	2621	26230	1808	8425	53335	79817	114907	9315	23604	23493	114757	220382	2037	115207	22821	871	10461	64129	8434	55691	25925	3707	79192	25825	84034	4781	10144	10100	6347	81553	8313	4212	84617	23024	817	221061	8660	1112	7022	8321	708	9331	9448	2308	8543	51585	5912	4902

BACKGROUND: Skeletal muscle is a complex, versatile tissue composed of a variety of functionally diverse fiber types. Although the biochemical, structural and functional properties of myofibers have been the subject of intense investigation for the last decades, understanding molecular processes regulating fiber type diversity is still complicated by the heterogeneity of cell types present in the whole muscle organ. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We have produced a first catalogue of genes expressed in mouse slow-oxidative (type 1) and fast-glycolytic (type 2B) fibers through transcriptome analysis at the single fiber level (microgenomics). Individual fibers were obtained from murine soleus and EDL muscles and initially classified by myosin heavy chain isoform content. Gene expression profiling on high density DNA oligonucleotide microarrays showed that both qualitative and quantitative improvements were achieved, compared to results with standard muscle homogenate. First, myofiber profiles were virtually free from non-muscle transcriptional activity. Second, thousands of muscle-specific genes were identified, leading to a better definition of gene signatures in the two fiber types as well as the detection of metabolic and signaling pathways that are differentially activated in specific fiber types. Several regulatory proteins showed preferential expression in slow myofibers. Discriminant analysis revealed novel genes that could be useful for fiber type functional classification. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: As gene expression analyses at the single fiber level significantly increased the resolution power, this innovative approach would allow a better understanding of the adaptive transcriptomic transitions occurring in myofibers under physiological and pathological conditions.					58	88	1410	3315	26548	347273	4621	4624	4625	4633	4634	9499	51778	23676	219537	7134	7135	7138	7139	7169	165904	487	488	844	845	26287	8048	2273	2274	8337	4617	4773	9124	5465	10891

HORTON_SREBF_TARGETS	M3009		14512514	Horton JD,Shah NA,Warrington JA,Anderson NN,Park SW,Brown MS,Goldstein JL		Table 1			MG_U74Av2	Arthur Liberzon	Broad Institute	Genes up-regulated in liver from mice transgenic for SREBF1 or SREBF2 [GeneID = 6720, 6721] and down-regulated in mice lacking SCAP [GeneID=22937].	The synthesis of fatty acids and cholesterol, the building blocks of membranes, is regulated by three membrane-bound transcription factors: sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBP)-1a, -1c, and -2. Their function in liver has been characterized in transgenic mice that overexpress each SREBP isoform and in mice that lack all three nuclear SREBPs as a result of gene knockout of SREBP cleavage-activating protein (SCAP), a protein required for nuclear localization of SREBPs. Here, we use oligonucleotide arrays hybridized with RNA from livers of three lines of mice (transgenic for SREBP-1a, transgenic for SREBP-2, and knockout for SCAP) to identify genes that are likely to be direct targets of SREBPs in liver. A total of 1,003 genes showed statistically significant increased expression in livers of transgenic SREBP-1a mice, 505 increased in livers of transgenic SREBP-2 mice, and 343 showed decreased expression in Scap-/- livers. A subset of 33 genes met the stringent combinatorial criteria of induction in both SREBP transgenics and decreased expression in SCAP-deficient mice. Of these 33 genes, 13 were previously identified as direct targets of SREBP action. Of the remaining 20 genes, 13 encode enzymes or carrier proteins involved in cholesterol metabolism, 3 participate in fatty acid metabolism, and 4 have no known connection to lipid metabolism. Through application of stringent combinatorial criteria, the transgenic/knockout approach allows identification of genes whose activities are likely to be controlled directly by one family of transcription factors, in this case the SREBPs.					65985	7108	2224	6713	79071	55902	51109	2194	1717	10654	134429	230	4199	3422	1595	2222	51478	31	6309	3949	3638	3157	255738	47	4047

MoGene-1_0_st	Roel Quintens	Belgian Nuclear Research Centre	Genes up-regulated in the mouse embryonic brain or immature neurons at 2 h or 6 h, respectively after exposure to 1 Gy dose of ionizing radiation.	The mammalian brain is especially sensitive to ionizing radiation during development, as shown by the increased occurrence of mental retardation and small head size in children who were in utero exposed to ionizing radiation after the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. These effects of prenatal irradiation can be mimicked by irradiation of mouse embryos during the organogenesis period. In order to better understand the early effects of ionizing radiation on the embryonic brain and immature neurons, we performed a microarray analysis on brains from mice irradiated with different doses at E11 and E14, as well as primary cortical neuron cultures at 14 h in vitro. RNA was extracted at either 2 h (brains) or 6 h (neurons) post-irradiation. This gene set includes genes that were differentially expressed in at least two different conditions, to generate a bona fide list of early radiation-responsive genes in the embryonic mouse brain.					138162	220042	9766	55924	80017	64782	271	228432	63982	317	116984	283638	51776	10458	581	27113	126868	73689	7832	900	55561	1026	10669	26586	126129	26094	51181	115265	163259	60401	9538	2052	2073	355	2309	2681	10020	10936	57822	51512	55766	3241	57722	256949	23175	55367	7867	217166	23612	10769	5366	51426	8493	130814	79056	5911	5912	254225	83667	10560	6890	11138	51768	55266	216395	8795	10906	94241	9099	51028	51043	22891	79755	64393	98303	2567	83872	5166	5784	5820	79651	9717	56977	84669
