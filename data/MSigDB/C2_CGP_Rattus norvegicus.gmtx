IWANAGA_E2F1_TARGETS_INDUCED_BY_SERUM	M1172		16288221	Iwanaga R,Komori H,Ishida S,Okamura N,Nakayama K,Nakayama KI,Ohtani K		Table 2			RAT_GENE_SYMBOL	Arthur Liberzon	Broad Institute	Genes up-regulated in REF52 cells (embryonic fibroblast) by expression of E2F1 [GeneID=1869] that were also induced at 16 hr after serum stimulation.	The transcription factor E2F mediates cell cycle-dependent expression of genes important for cell proliferation in response to growth stimulation. To further understand the role of E2F, we utilized a sensitive subtraction method to explore new E2F1 targets, which are expressed at low levels and might have been unrecognized in previous studies. We identified 33 new E2F1-inducible genes, including checkpoint genes Claspin and Rad51ap1, and four genes with unknown function required for cell cycle progression. Moreover, we found three groups of E2F1-inducible genes that were not induced by growth stimulation. At least, two groups of genes were directly induced by E2F1, indicating that E2F1 can regulate expression of genes not induced during the cell cycle. One included Neogenin, WASF1 and SGEF genes, which may have a role in differentiation or development. The other was the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27(Kip1), which was involved in suppression of inappropriate cell cycle progression induced by deregulated E2F. E2F1-responsive regions of these genes were located more upstream than those of typical E2F targets and did not have typical E2F sites. These results indicate that there are groups of E2F1 targets, which are regulated in a distinct manner from that of typical E2F targets.					78995	10635	3148	4288	283464	283209	8487	91614	63979	4594	6546	7782	1763	9702	84333	23462	63967	63901	8898	132	22919	64946	9063	260425	79682	7750	11168	54801	25941	8836	10733

Silencing of gene expression by methylation of CpG islands in regulatory elements is frequently observed in cancer. However, an influence of the most common oncogenic signalling pathways onto DNA methylation has not yet been investigated thoroughly. To address this issue, we identified genes suppressed in HRAS-transformed rat fibroblasts but upregulated after treatment with the demethylating agent 5-Aza-2-deoxycytidine and with the MEK1,2 inhibitor U0126. Analysis of gene expression by microarray and Northern blot analysis revealed the MEK/ERK target genes clusterin, matrix metalloproteinase 2 (Mmp2), peptidylpropyl isomerase C-associated protein, syndecan 4, Timp2 and Thbs1 to be repressed in the HRAS-transformed FE-8 cells in a MEK/ERK- and methylation-dependent manner. Hypermethylation of putative regulatory elements in HRAS-transformed cells as compared to immortalized fibroblasts was detected within a CpG island 14.5 kb upstream of clusterin, within the clusterin promoter and within a CpG island of the Mmp2 promoter by bisulphite sequencing. Furthermore, hypermethylation of the clusterin promoter was observed 10 days after induction of HRAS in immortalized rat fibroblasts and a clear correlation between reduced clusterin expression and hypermethlyation could also be observed in distinct rat tissues. These results suggest that silencing of individual genes by DNA methylation is controlled by oncogenic signalling pathways, yet the mechanisms responsible for initial target gene suppression are variable.					8611	6047	3280	4851	6382	7077	3021	3162	4953	84336	6868	5437	84557	1191	6385	262
YAN_ESCAPE_FROM_ANOIKIS	M1221		16007176	Yan SR,Joseph RR,Rosen K,Reginato MJ,Jackson A,Allaire N,Brugge JS,Jobin C,Stadnyk AW		Table 1S			SEQ_ACCESSION	Arthur Liberzon	Broad Institute	Genes up-regulated in IEC-18 cells (intestinal epithelial cells) which avoided anoikis (a form of apoptosis) after detachment.	We reported earlier that IL-1beta, an NF-kappaB-regulated cytokine, was made by intestinal epithelial cells during detachment-induced apoptosis (anoikis) and that IL-1 was antiapoptotic for detached cells. Since surviving anoikis is a prerequisite for cancer progression and metastases, we are further exploring the link between anoikis and cytokines. Here we determined that multiple genes are expressed following detachment including a number of NF-kappaB-regulated products and therefore aimed to determine whether NF-kappaB signalling plays any role in regulating apoptosis. Using Western blotting, we detected that IkappaBalpha becomes phosphorylated immediately following detachment and that levels of phospho-IkappaBalpha peaked within 20 min. Phosphorylation of IkappaBalpha was followed by Rel A (p65) nuclear translocation. Increased NF-kappaB activity following detachment was confirmed using the detection of NF-kappaB-promoted luciferase gene expression delivered by adenovirus infection. Infection of cells with adenovirus expressing a super-repressor IkappaBalpha protein and pharmacological inhibitors of NF-kappaB resulted in the failure to phosphorylate IkappaBalpha, a more rapid activation of caspases and earlier apoptosis. We also detected that IkappaB kinase alpha (IKKalpha) and not IKKbeta became phosphorylated following detachment. Since IKKalpha is activated by NF-kappaB-inducing kinase (NIK), we overexpressed native NIK using an adenovirus vector that resulted in enhanced phospho-IkappaBalpha and nuclear p65 in detached cells compared to control detached cells but did not result in a significantly greater number of cells surviving to 24 h. We conclude that detachment directly activates NF-kappaB, which, in addition to launching an inflammatory cytokine wave, contributes to a delay in apoptosis in intestinal epithelial cells.					629	4843	960	3600	100506736	91543	5610	1649	6364	3133	4313	6352	4049	3108	4790	6773	3665	10018	3659	3627	7412	6376	6772	218
STANHILL_HRAS_TRANSFROMATION_UP	M1265		16278678	Stanhill A,Levin V,Hendel A,Shachar I,Kazanov D,Arber N,Kaminski N,Engelberg D		Table 1			SEQ_ACCESSION	Leona Saunders	Broad Institute	Selected genes up-regulated in Rat1Ras cells (fibroblasts) which were transformed by expression of an oncogenic activated form of HRAS [GeneID=3265] compared to the parental Rat1 cells.	Heat shock proteins (Hsps) are overexpressed in many tumors, but are downregulated in some tumors. To check for a direct effect of Ha-Ras(val12) on HSP70 transcription, we transiently expressed the oncoprotein in Rat1 fibroblasts and monitored its effect on HSP70b promoter-driven reporter gene. We show that expression of Ha-Ras(val12) induced this promoter. Promoter analysis via systematic deletions and point mutations revealed that Ha-Ras(val12) induces HSP70b transcription via heat shock elements (HSEs). Also, Ha-Ras(val12) induction of HSE-mediated transcription was dramatically reduced in HSF1-/- cells. Yet, residual effect of Ha-Ras(val12) that was still measured in HSF1-/- cells suggests that some of the Ha-Ras(val12) effect is Hsf1-independent. When HSF1-/- cells, stably expressing Ha-Ras(val12), were grown on soft agar only small colonies were formed suggesting a role for heat shock factor 1 (Hsf1) in Ha-Ras(val12)-mediated transformation. Although Ha-ras(Val12) seems to be an inducer of HSP70's expression, we found that in Ha-ras(Val12-)transformed fibroblasts expression of this gene is suppressed. This suppression is correlated with higher sensitivity of Ha-ras(val12)-transformed cells to heat shock. We suggest that Ha-ras(Val12) is involved in Hsf1 activation, thereby inducing the cellular protective response. Cells that repress this response are perhaps those that acquire the capability to further proliferate and become transformed clones.					3303	2353	1843	1410	3315	3162	3304	3725

To dissect the major determinants of LVM, we combined expression quantitative trait locus1 and quantitative trait transcript (QTT) analyses of the cardiac transcriptome in the rat. Using these methods and in vitro functional assays, we identified osteoglycin (Ogn) as a major candidate regulator of rat LVM, with increased Ogn protein expression associated with elevated LVM. We also applied genome-wide QTT analysis to the human heart and observed that, out of 22,000 transcripts, OGN transcript abundance had the highest correlation with LVM.

ABBUD_LIF_SIGNALING_2_UP	M1439		14576184	Abbud RA,Kelleher R,Melmed S		Table 3			SEQ_ACCESSION	Kevin Vogelsang	Broad Institute	Genes up-regulated in GH3 cells (pituitary cancer) after treatment with LIF [GeneID=3976].	Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) mediates the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal stress response. Transgenic mice overexpressing LIF in the developing pituitary have altered pituitary differentiation with expansion of corticotropes, maintenance of Rathke's cleft cysts, and suppression of all other pituitary cell types. Affymetrix GeneChips were used to identify modulators of LIF effects in corticotrope (AtT-20) and somatolactotrope (GH(3)) cells. In addition to genes known to respond to LIF in corticotrope cells [e.g. suppressor of cytokine signaling-3 (SOCS-3), signal transducer and activator of transcription-3, SH2 domain-containing tyrosine phosphatase-1, and proopiomelanocortin (POMC)], corticotrope-specific changes were also observed for genes involved in glycolysis and gluconeogenesis, transcription factors, signaling molecules, and expressed sequence tags. Two transcription factors identified, CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein beta (C/EBPbeta) and glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF)-inducible factor (GIF), dose-dependently induced expression of the rat POMC promoter when overexpressed in AtT-20 cells. LIF further induced POMC transcription with C/EBPbeta, but not with GIF. C/EBPbeta also induced expression of the SOCS-3 promoter that was further enhanced by cotreatment with LIF. However, GIF did not affect SOCS-3 expression. These results indicate that C/EBPbeta and GIF are downstream effectors of LIF corticotrope action. LIF also stimulates the expression of inhibitors of its actions, such as SOCS-3 and SH2 domain-containing tyrosine phosphatase-1. alpha(2)-HS-glycoprotein (AHSG)/fetuin, a secreted protein that antagonizes bone TGFbeta/bone morphogenic protein signaling, was induced by LIF in a signal transducer and activator of transcription-3-dependent fashion. Pretreatment with AHSG/fetuin blocked LIF-induced expression of the POMC promoter independently of SOCS-3. Thus, using GeneChips, C/EBPbeta and GIF have been identified as novel mediators and AHSG/fetuin as an inhibitor of LIF action in corticotropes.					481	3726	5214	2260	5521	2877	7430	284	1301	388125	5800	1734	1634	8829

KALMA_E2F1_TARGETS	M10142		11313881	Kalma Y,Marash L,Lamed Y,Ginsberg D		Table 1: full names changed to symbols			HUMAN_GENE_SYMBOL	John Newman	University of Washington	DNA replication genes up-regulated in a Rat-1a cell line (fibroblast) by expression of E2F1 [GeneID=1869].	The transcription factor E2F-1 plays a pivotal role in the regulation of G1/S transition in higher eukaryotes cell cycle. We used a cell line containing an inducible E2F-1 and oligonucleotide microarray analysis to identify novel E2F target genes. We show that E2F-1 up-regulates the expression of a number of genes coding for components of the DNA replication machinery. Among them is the gene coding for the 32 Kd subunit of replication protein A (RPA2). Replication protein A is the most abundant single strand DNA binding complex and it is essential for DNA replication. We demonstrate that RPA2 is a novel E2F target gene whose expression can be directly regulated by E2F-1 via E2F binding sites in its promoter. In addition, expression of Topoisomerase IIalpha and subunit IV of DNA polymerase alpha is also up-regulated upon E2F-1 induction. Taken together, these results provide novel links between components of the DNA replication machinery and the cell growth regulatory pathway involving the Rb tumor suppressor and E2F.					2237	5424	892	4175	5984	23649	4171	6118	7153	5111	7298
SASSON_FSH_RESPONSE	M1663		12832290	Sasson R,Dantes A,Tajima K,Amsterdam A		Table 1A			SEQ_ACCESSION	John Newman	University of Washington	Genes up-regulated in rFSH-17 cells (primary granulosa) after stimulation with FSH.	Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) controls the development of follicle-enclosed oocytes in the mammalian ovary by interacting with specific receptors located exclusively on granulosa cells. Its biological activity involves stimulation of intercellular communication, intracellular signaling, and up-regulation of steroidogenesis; the entire spectrum of genes regulated by FSH is not yet fully characterized. We have established monoclonal rat FSH-responsive granulosa cell lines that express FSH receptors at 20-fold higher rates than with primary cells, and thus increased the probability of yielding a distinct spectrum of genes modulated by FSH. Using Affymetrix DNA microarrays, we discovered 11 genes not reported earlier to be up-regulated by FSH and 9 genes not reported earlier to be down-regulated by FSH. Modulation of signal transduction associated with G-protein signaling, phosphorylation of proteins, and intracellular-extracellular ion balance was suggested by up-regulation of decay accelerating factor GPI-form precursor (DAF), membrane interacting protein RGS16, protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTPase), oxidative stress-inducible protein tyrosine phosphatase (OSIPTPase), and down-regulation of rat prostatic acid phosphatase (rPAP), Na+, K+-ATPase, and protein phosphatase 1beta. Elevation in granzyme-like proteins 1 and 3, and natural killer (NK) cell protease 1 (NKP-1) along with reduction in carboxypeptidase E indicates possible FSH-mediated preparation of the cells for apoptosis. Up-regulation of vascular endothelial growth factors indicates the ability of FSH to produce angiogenic factors upon their maturation; whereas, reduction in insulin-like growth factor binding protein (IGFBP3) indicates its increased potential to promote p53-induced apoptosis. Striking similarities in FSH modulation of gene expression were found in primary cultures of human granulosa cells obtained from IVF patients although these cells expressed only 1% of FSH receptor compared with immortalized rat cells, as indicated by microarray technique, which probably is in the normal range of expression of this receptor in nontransformed cells. These findings should increase our understanding of the mechanism of FSH action in stimulating development of the ovarian follicular cells, of intracellular and intercellular communication, and of increasing the potential of ovarian follicular cells to undergo apoptosis during the process of selection of the dominant follicle.					1843	4502	7422	2230	6770	51573	4886	1604	2355

Although HMGA1 (high-mobility group A1; formerly HMG-I/Y) is an oncogene that is widely overexpressed in aggressive cancers, the molecular mechanisms underlying transformation by HMGA1 are only beginning to emerge. HMGA1 encodes the HMGA1a and HMGA1b protein isoforms, which function in regulating gene expression. To determine how HMGA1 leads to neoplastic transformation, we looked for genes regulated by HMGA1 using gene expression profile analysis. Here, we show that the STAT3 gene, which encodes the signaling molecule signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), is a critical downstream target of HMGA1a. STAT3 mRNA and protein are up-regulated in fibroblasts overexpressing HMGA1a and activated STAT3 recapitulates the transforming activity of HMGA1a in fibroblasts. HMGA1a also binds directly to a conserved region of the STAT3 promoter in vivo in human leukemia cells by chromatin immunoprecipitation and activates transcription of the STAT3 promoter in transfection experiments. To determine if this pathway contributes to HMGA1-mediated transformation, we investigated STAT3 expression in our HMGA1a transgenic mice, all of which developed aggressive lymphoid malignancy. STAT3 expression was increased in the leukemia cells from our transgenics but not in control cells. Blocking STAT3 function induced apoptosis in the transgenic leukemia cells but not in controls. In primary human leukemia samples, there was a positive correlation between HMGA1a and STAT3 mRNA. Moreover, blocking STAT3 function in human leukemia or lymphoma cells led to decreased cellular motility and foci formation. Our results show that the HMGA1a-STAT3 axis is a potential Achilles heel that could be exploited therapeutically in hematopoietic and other malignancies overexpressing HMGA1a.					4342	6218	2690	6965	1327	5023	84812	4257	2560	4792	1938	6863	2830	5111	3326	9377	7077	2100	6647	728	1910	7852	1072	6143	2569	7415	207	43	3667	1630	4852	7037	10327	4117	6869	3482	6135	5682	3397	5694	2911	4613	567	3362	4282	6538	3329	3265	2741	4831	9296	1140	1397	6205	6189	517	2920	917	4893	5406	369	4756	226	4830	3315	2064	6223	7043	292	6166	6137	2353	6206	5376	3643	2878	516	515	6774	3399	3984	6144	2764	2946	1191	1514	2880	3398	6374	7083

To identify methylation-silenced genes in prostate cancers, a microarray analysis for genes up-regulated by treatment with a demethylating agent, 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine, was performed using three rat prostate cancer cell lines. Eight genes (Aebp1, Dysf, Gas6, LOC361288, Nnat, Ocm, RGD1308119, and Tgfbr2) were re-expressed at 16-fold or more, and their promoter CpG islands were shown to be densely methylated in the cancer cell lines. From the eight genes, Tgfbr2, a key mediator of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) signaling that has been strongly implicated in human and rat prostate carcinogenesis, was selected, and its silencing in primary samples was analyzed further. Tgfbr2 was methylated and markedly down-regulated in three of seven 3,2'-dimethyl-4-aminobiphenyl-induced invasive adenocarcinomas in the dorsolateral lobe of the rat prostate. In humans, marked down-regulation of TGFBR2 protein was observed in 12 of 20 high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia and 36 of 60 prostate cancers. DNA methylation of the human TGFBR2 promoter CpG islands repressed transcription, if present, but neither methylation nor mutation were detected in 27 human prostate cancers analyzed. Methylation silencing of rat Tgfbr2 was associated with histone H3 lysine 9 trimethylation, whereas decreased expression of human TGFBR2 was mainly due to decreased transcription activity, sometimes in concert with histone deacetylation and H3 lysine 27 trimethylation. The identification of methylation silencing of Tgfbr2 in rat prostate cancers, in accordance with TGFBR2 down-regulation in human prostate cancers, will enable us to analyze how aberrant methylation is induced in vivo and identify factors that promote and suppress the induction of aberrant methylation.					4951	7048	196394	2621	165	4826	8291

Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a common disease among elderly people that, when surgical treatment is inapplicable, results in progressive expansion and rupture of the aorta with high mortality. Although nonsurgical treatment for AAA is much awaited, few options are available because its molecular pathogenesis remains elusive. Here, we identify JNK as a proximal signaling molecule in the pathogenesis of AAA. Human AAA tissue showed a high level of phosphorylated JNK. We show that JNK programs a gene expression pattern in different cell types that cooperatively enhances the degradation of the extracellular matrix while suppressing biosynthetic enzymes of the extracellular matrix. Selective inhibition of JNK in vivo not only prevented the development of AAA but also caused regression of established AAA in two mouse models. Thus, JNK promotes abnormal extracellular matrix metabolism in the tissue of AAA and may represent a therapeutic

Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a common disease among elderly people that, when surgical treatment is inapplicable, results in progressive expansion and rupture of the aorta with high mortality. Although nonsurgical treatment for AAA is much awaited, few options are available because its molecular pathogenesis remains elusive. Here, we identify JNK as a proximal signaling molecule in the pathogenesis of AAA. Human AAA tissue showed a high level of phosphorylated JNK. We show that JNK programs a gene expression pattern in different cell types that cooperatively enhances the degradation of the extracellular matrix while suppressing biosynthetic enzymes of the extracellular matrix. Selective inhibition of JNK in vivo not only prevented the development of AAA but also caused regression of established AAA in two mouse models. Thus, JNK promotes abnormal extracellular matrix metabolism in the tissue of AAA and may represent a therapeutic target.					1647	6748	9275	7203	84300	26092	3558	10919	5742	732	262	2017	23077	51361	8406	4635	3728	285971	6185	4149	4342	2989	7534	376497	11252	2321	1595	1270	6198	3156	3458	1052	7112	29966	54529	3569	8243	2012	5608	84061	10647	5925	3717	71	3638	5163	2335	1783	2331	10404	9221	10282	2800	871	79026	6307	6586	1432	387496	6146	4928	9584	26037	3313	81671	2444	267	2760	10923	26515	7422	6560	3312	4756	64223	3416	3572	5660	10418	207	9797	5447	4047	998	8671	1186	3274	8615	7153	23256	3708	4087	6351	2274	80351	9343	7174	2891	149371	27044	10928	7782	6597	174	1106	3084	3032	2180	2820	5393	1650	5306	10243	5705	5033	7412	92140	57018	5682	7867	4706	9223	5367	23788	7032	3157	10294	2730	5230	5825	5108	5797	5738	1950	6533	3488	4973	1266	54918	2147	5879	1734	113220	2782	226	81	10321	10808	1983	143879	8968	5792	10787	3930	7037	6929	54467	112399	58189	64759	4436	58527	5701	9927	2517	3712	479	9019	9975	9201	285598	29991	1723	27020	1906	4620	526	3952	10952	10328	4836	3695	2627	5814	715	10955	6566	5876	917	4053	6421	4929	921	5170	6319	9774	1848	361	682	64976	9373	283489	523	182	25943	10972	5351	196	2063	8869	11329	3797	26276	9818	26225	9733	3949	1471	1022	29968	6428	515	4345	7326	1113	5479	5208	1289	4191	31	7965	7434	2230	4774	26471	79602	25841	9748	7178	84181	5795	4609	5453	27161	84923	10238	5756	847	6400	627	4763	51126	6047	7071	7857	224	11163	9135	53938	5354	4223	10411	4086	80777	27347	51382	54867	211	8739	158471	383	55723	5245	29970	334	10001	5376	100287932	8473	1990	166336	26007	9377	1315	170961	4883	5664	27230	6281	8573	3064	5786	6038	85457	538	2162	7078	1491	57678	6810	3911	3489	6383	5710	1803	7026	1455	9516	149954	962	9060	2260	2224	5604	7039	2244	4133	4717	8893	90	7009	4898	4953	666	26585	55095	7095	1301	4830	6434	55101	80349	3181	3988	5408	4924	152579	1622	3964	5142	9559	133	6822	3832	8553	9380	11267	57187	23036	4189	773	5471	1130	6935	3176	57136	1785	9475	1054	5156	11261	8028	18	6923	351	4931

BACKGROUND: The tumor microenvironment is being increasingly recognized as an important determinant of tumor progression as well as of therapeutic response. We investigated oncolytic virus (OV) therapy-induced changes in tumor blood vessels and the impact of modulating tumor vasculature on the efficacy of oncolytic virus therapy. METHODS: Rat glioma cells (D74/HveC) were implanted intracranially in immune-competent rats. Seven days later, the rats (groups of 3-7 rats) were treated with oncolytic virus (hrR3), and, 3 days later, brains were harvested for evaluation. Some rats were treated with angiostatic cRGD peptide 4 days before oncolytic virus treatment. Some rats were treated with cyclophosphamide (CPA), an immunosuppressant, 2 days before oncolytic virus treatment. Changes in tumor vascular perfusion were evaluated by magnetic resonance imaging of live rats and by fluorescence microscopy of tumor sections from rats perfused with Texas red-conjugated lectin immediately before euthanasia. Leukocyte infiltration in tumors was evaluated by anti-CD45 immunohistochemistry, and the presence of oncolytic virus in tumors was evaluated by viral titration. Changes in cytokine gene expression in tumors were measured by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction-based microarrays. Survival was analyzed by the Kaplan-Meier method. All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: Oncolytic virus treatment of experimental rat gliomas increased tumor vascular permeability, host leukocyte infiltration into tumors, and intratumoral expression of inflammatory cytokine genes, including interferon gamma (IFN-gamma). The increase in vascular permeability was suppressed in rats pretreated with cyclophosphamide. Compared with rats treated with hrR3 alone, rats pretreated with a single dose of cRGD peptide before hrR3 treatment had reduced tumor vascular permeability, leukocyte infiltration, and IFN-gamma protein levels (mean IFN-gamma level for hrR3 versus hrR3 + cRGD = 203 versus 65.6 microg/mg, difference = 137 microg/mg, 95% confidence interval = 72.7 to 202.9 microg/mg, P = .006); increased viral titers in tumor tissue; and longer median survival (21 days versus 17 days, P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: A single dose of angiostatic cRGD peptide treatment before oncolytic virus treatment enhanced the antitumor efficacy of oncolytic virus.					6347	3579	7124	3597	718	7133	3589	3552	6367	643	834	1230	7850	4049	3603	3606	6696	26525	959	729230	3561	3600	3570	4050	6354	3587	1233	3553	6352	2833	3627	4283	2920	10803	3684	6348	1235	6364	3572	2829	1236	3560	3458	1234

Estrogen-related receptors (ERRs) play critical roles in regulation of cellular energy metabolism in response to inducible coactivators such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) coactivator 1alpha (PGC-1alpha). A yeast two-hybrid screen led to the identification of the cytokine-stimulated transcriptional regulator, Bcl3, as an ERRalpha coactivator. Bcl3 was shown to synergize with PGC-1alpha to coactivate ERRalpha. Chromatin immunoprecipitation studies demonstrated that ERRalpha, PGC-1alpha, and Bcl3 form a complex on an ERRalpha-responsive element within the pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 gene promoter in cardiac myocytes. Mapping studies demonstrated that Bc13 interacts with PGC-1alpha and ERRalpha, allowing for interaction with both proteins. Transcriptional profiling demonstrated that Bcl3 activates genes involved in diverse pathways including a subset involved in cellular energy metabolism known to be regulated by PGC-1alpha, ERRalpha, and a second nuclear receptor, PPARalpha. Consistent with the gene expression profiling results, Bcl3 was shown to synergistically coactivate PPARalpha with PGC-1alpha in a manner similar to ERRalpha. We propose that the cooperativity between Bcl3 and PGC-1alpha may serve as a point of convergence on nuclear receptor targets to direct programs orchestrating inflammatory and energy metabolism responses in heart and other tissues.					10733	10460	10891	57211	55972	220441	5367	9630	983	7318	6936	1525	3488	30811	762	7352	3263	3664	5274	8516	8532	5414	9671	2819	55166	80152	2042	890	53340	9133	339983	54677	51599	10826	9134	5055	10461	11045	9585	5213	10060	4726	7771	8013	4747	23551	100131454	5010	9728	2745	51616	7472	6330	59345	79718	114880	29127	6773	51542	6258	7504	3795	4886	6382	7138	57282	55635	1075	4311	3437	54478	3547	7056	7043	115361	4969	51061	25984	9572	2634	58494	3665	26084	7049	9111	244	79827	79960	10558	4741	8313	7436	6356	10964	1666	4314	2194	27039	10112	64108	5190	5166	9068	84129	10635	1036	7018	54953	4435	84870	161253	11065	4973	3835	171586	57187	1375	132320	1906	27242	10157	7124	79071	7076	11332	23347	1160	894	3240	55601	11004	3569	3028	715	5054	4731	3430	56895	91543	10293	10875	79132	146712	9745	146	2628	4696	5179	92960	6274	27111	9435	6319	22795	643155	55364	9735	117247	730	2170	3479	80347	23082	140738	4343	4147	55103	81573	5764	5007	2305	81624	7385	6241	134111	9246	10351	63901	2643	7045	9700	5264	51129	85439	991	4043	5816	55638	6890	1356	34	55137	968	10189	55500	5208	1869	4734	83461	521	5125	3148	646627	10398	3991	286	2542	6515	53822	245806	1268	3431	6347	51203	9212	84708	9787	684	283373	1604	5698	11274	608	1993	83468	26291	27109	2	83988	37	64856	2491	891	84624	6646	4322	84695	6096	3300	137964	4621	157313	4902	5696	50804	54836	283897	1910	23678	6695	2882	55296	151636	23417	26586	9824	84080	6790	699	1152	55796	1374	60592	4695	10085	197257	7292	4288	4603	9055	4711	376267	5733	84808	54625	29089	85363	130733	5210	151126	25825	9023	127495	129607	10203	54832	1159	4319	83660	1031	51192	55281	1608	10125	113277	89958	80313	10965	19	5777	7571	55008	84532	29760	51666	57678	3489	5648	2027	56271	90417	3995	54502	2180	23043	22998	3030	340543	9771	23428	1894	223117	5327	81610	10777	8744	129642	5610	3627	9232	364	10973	285313	147841	79603	203522	7042	55276	9590	5165	5224	4729	7351	6648	3433	5193	4070	7153	2254	3164	7048	8638	374403	55872	6752	1992	404217	192111	7780	3570	84649	2181	54957	23136
