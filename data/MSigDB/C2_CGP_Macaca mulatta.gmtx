KAYO_CALORIE_RESTRICTION_MUSCLE_DN	M4270		11309484	Kayo T,Allison DB,Weindruch R,Prolla TA		Table 9S			Hu6800	John Newman	University of Washington	Downregulated in the vastus lateralis muscle of middle aged rhesus monkeys subjected to caloric restriction since young adulthood vs age matched controls	In laboratory rodents, caloric restriction (CR) retards several age-dependent physiological and biochemical changes in skeletal muscle, including increased steady-state levels of oxidative damage to lipids, DNA, and proteins. We have previously used high-density oligonucleotide arrays to show that CR can prevent or delay most of the major age-related transcriptional alterations in the gastrocnemius muscle of C57BL/6 mice. Here we report the effects of aging and adult-onset CR on the gene expression profile of 7,070 genes in the vastus lateralis muscle from rhesus monkeys. Gene expression analysis of aged rhesus monkeys (mean age of 26 years) was compared with that of young animals (mean age of 8 years). Aging resulted in a selective up-regulation of transcripts involved in inflammation and oxidative stress, and a down-regulation of genes involved in mitochondrial electron transport and oxidative phosphorylation. Middle-aged monkeys (mean age of 20 years) subjected to CR since early adulthood (mean age of 11 years) were studied to determine the gene expression profile induced by CR. CR resulted in an up-regulation of cytoskeletal protein-encoding genes, and also a decrease in the expression of genes involved in mitochondrial bioenergetics. Surprisingly, we did not observe any evidence for an inhibitory effect of adult-onset CR on age-related changes in gene expression. These results indicate that the induction of an oxidative stress-induced transcriptional response may be a common feature of aging in skeletal muscle of rodents and primates, but the extent to which CR modifies these responses may be species-specific.					7102	860	5452	6006	506	1891	8312	23530	7141	1244	221823	4843	4331	5030	1537	3108	2802	1327	150684	2078	337	7436	6150	1565	4351	5678	1409	5902	8789	11017	2776	7381	108	3033	56099	55000	3852	2806	4653	50486	30850	1351	10669	3265	10521	5867	6993	7257	1388	100289043	5438	654	1390	54498	2737	9962	3032	9276	8242	5408	7417	1827	10524	10449	23212	1280	8554	1622	49	58508	578	5998	10411	8528	6901	7385	4729	8178	43	87	4190	10955	1160	780	8720	5862	5824

Human ASCs (hASC) and rhesus BMSCs (rBMSC) underwent significantly more total population doublings than human BMSCs (hBMSC) and rhesus ASCs (rASC). The cell cycle profile of all MSCs was altered as cultures aged. hMSCs underwent an increase in the frequency of cells in the S phase at P20 and P30. However, rhesus MSCs from both sources developed a distinct polyploid population of cells at P20, which progressed to aneuploidy by P30. Karyotype analysis of MSCs revealed the development of tetraploid or aneuploid karyotypes in the rhesus cells at P20 or P30. Analysis of the transcriptome of the MSCs from early and late passages revealed significant alterations in the patterns of gene expression (8.8% of the genes were differentially expressed in hBMSCs versus hASCs, and 5.5% in rBMSCs versus rASCs). Gene expression changes were much less evident within the same cell type as aging occurred (0.7% in hMSCs and 0.9% in rMSC). Gene ontology analysis showed that functions involved in protein catabolism and regulation of pol II transcription were overrepresented in rASCs, whereas the regulation of I kappa B/nuclear factor-kappaB cascade were overrepresented in hBMSCs. Functional analysis of genes that were differentially expressed in rASCs and hBMSCs revealed that pathways involved in cell cycle, cell cycle checkpoints, protein-ubiquitination, and apoptosis were altered.					9788	1992	51635	5274	9444	10982	10606	10656	182	6924	25819	50863	29886	1848	8942	65108	53831	57580	4094	7422	1004	834	9989	175	11277	81618	9749	10098	4501	83478	2596	54436	3106	10212	960	26099	5327	10658	10783	29109	9447	3241	81832	9454	23657	3207	2122	5764	3134	4494	27333	10123	84876	51056	57226	2113	1687	51363	64968	22949	3107	4000	23216	115123	5699	4217	121355	4067	23314	5154	7026	4502	10189	5552	9976	3206	57559	8459	57520	2782	7378	3162	51703	84419	5696	81706	5698	7804	22795	10265	4927	3137	11031	5573	1728	136	3187	8835	7371	648	10312	30011	9540	9991	5796	3037	5325	7020	5243	22822	4495	23406	254428	2762	84883	2009	7262	4953	5244	8061	1123	8091	387923	8566	10586	2027
